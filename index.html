<h4>Risk assessment of fire hazard in coal mines using data analysis</h4><p>
Problem Statement The energy derived from coal in India is about twice that of energy derived from oil. As coal is mined, there is always a risk of fire hazard at these coal mining sites. Hydraulic fluids are widely used in mining machineries. These hydraulic fluids are combustible and are used to transmit power and motion. Pressurized hydraulic fluids present a considerable fire hazard where ignition source is present. Mixing of hydraulic fluid with coal increases the risk of fire hazard in the mines. In view of the above, fire resistant characteristics of hydraulic fluids (Flame propagation, Spray Ignition, Auto-ignition Temperature etc.) needs to be experimentally studied under the simulated conditions. Data of experimental studies needs to be analyzed theoretically to assess the fire risk and to suggest preventive actions. 3. Sample Data Required, if yes, please describe: Experimental data on the fire resistant characteristics of different types of commercially available hydraulic fluids will be required for the theoretical risk assessment. 4.

<h4>Cost effective On-Cloud (Privately owned by government) solution for Zero-Day Attack Protection for advanced Persistent Threat/ Advance threat prevention for Government sectors</h4><p>
2. Problem Statement Govt Offices and Research Institute networks are at continuous risk of target base cyber attacks, such as phishing, dangerous exploits, advanced Threats like sophisticated malware and zero-day threats. Such attacks are risk to organisation for their privacy and integrity of data and knowledge base To combat these Zero day attack or Advance Threat many security vendors have solutions such as Advance threat prevention/protection such as sandboxing which scans the files coming to network combines hardware-level inspection and OS-level sandboxing to prevent infection from the most exploits, malwares, zero-day and targeted attacks entering the networks These solutions are mostly based on Cloud-based Service or highly expensive On-premise appliances based solution. It’s not the best practice to scan Government data for Zero day attack or Advance Threat on a third party cloud as files are uploaded and downloaded back and forth to vendors cloud for sandboxing .This raise the issues of data privacy and integrity as we are using cloud services of private vendors Therefore a Cost effective On-Cloud (Privately owned by government) solution for Zero-Day Attack Protection for advanced Persistent Threat/ Advance threat prevention must be designed so the government data can be sandboxed on government owned private cloud itself for data as well as network security and can be widely used among different government sectors. 3.

<h4>Web based Data Analytics software/framework for performing technology impact assessment of any CSIR technologies</h4><p>
2. Problem Statement More often research problems in Indian R&D institutions are initiated based on top down instructions/directions that may or may not has relevance in terms of science, demand, resource availability as because technology developer and the actors associated with the life cycle works independently. The evolutionary model should ensure the marriage of Techno-Social System (Technology plus actors association) and technological regime (scientific rule sets plus resource constraints). In order to do such assessments for any new technologies developed in CSIR institutions, for that matter in all R&D institutions, does not have in-house trained resources. Preparation of new technology related plans, data collection, data representation, mapping to the socio-economical policies and regularities considering all kinds of effects, including second order effects, needs a software tools with certain degree of customization. The proposed software should be web enabled, data could be collected, represented, analyzed online and results could be shared among all the actors in technology/product life cycle so that product/technology development and deployment shall be assessed and managed in accordance with social aims and expectations. 3. Sample Data Required, if yes, please describe: Students may be allowed prepare some sample data that could be imagined for a specific product as a case study.

<h4>Smartphone App (Android) for providing agro advisories for medicinal and aromatic growers, enterprenuers and industries on plant disease/nutrient management, buyer/seller corner and market intelligenc</h4><p>
2. Problem Statement The cultivation of medicinal and aromatic crops can help in doubling the farm income. However, the growth of this agriculture sector requires intensive knowledge dissemination and hand holding of the farmers at various stages. CSIR – CIMAP is a premier research laboratory of CSIR, which is involved in multidisciplinary high quality research in agricultural, biological and chemical sciences and extending technologies and services to the farmers, entrepreneurs and industries of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs). This smartphone app developed should aim to bridge the knowledge GAP between the farmers, entrepreneurs, industries and scientific fraternity in the areas of agriculture, processing and market availability for fuelling the growth of medicinal and aroma industry and rural employment. This app should enable the user to capture the geo coded medicinal and aromatic plant related data to be uploaded in the central server, which, in turn can be used by the subject matter specialist (scientist) to provide suitable advisory on near real time basis. The app should also provide a buyer/seller corner with a moderator to provide a virtual platform for the buyers and sellers. It would help in removing the intermediaries and in turn increase the profitability to the farmer and industry. The app should have feature to use the market intelligence data from the database, APIs of the market data available (open source or subscription based) on medicinal and aromatic crops to be made available to the farmers, entrepreneurs and industries. 3.

<h4>Computational approaches to understand corrosion mechanism under extreme conditions</h4><p>
2. Problem Statement Corrosion is a worldwide problem which causes billions of dollar damage every year. Progress in corrosion sciences has helped in development of new materials and coatings which can withstand corrosion for years. However, corrosion mechanisms under extreme conditions (such as high/low temperature and pressure) are yet to be understood due to limitation of experimental procedures under extreme conditions. Nuclear, aerospace, gas/oil, and chemical industries are major areas affected by such type of corrosion. Computational methods can be really helpful for this kind of problem. Using computational procedures, one can simulate various types of extreme conditions, for example, high/low temperature and pressure. A combination of quantum chemical and molecular dynamic methods can give full insight of corrosion mechanism at atomistic level and rate of growth of corrosion under extreme conditions. The work plan is divided as follow: 1) Determining mechanism of corrosion under extreme conditions 2) Investigation of growth of corrosion nuclei 3) Finding the factors affecting corrosion rate 4) Suggesting methods to reduce corrosion 3. Sample Data Required, if yes, please describe: Yes. Data is required to validate findings. This data can be collected from available literature. 4.

<h4>Mechanism for prescribing drug in hospitals and its or its substitute availability in the medical shops of the area/ city</h4><p>
Every citizen of the country visit a doctor or hospital in his lifetime for different health-related reasons In order to treat the patient doctors prescribes drug which may be generic or unique which is purchased from a medical shop. It is often seen that patient has to visit several medical shops to fetch the prescribed medicine as he is unaware of different options for a drug salt available to him. Therefore an application can developed wherein the prescription from a doctor/hospital is digitalized and directly transferred to patient or caretaker who may have an app to assess the options and availability of the drug in the vicinity/ city. This may require linking all brand names for a drug/ or it salt in a database which may be available to the doctor and the user. Simultaneously this database may be linked with availability of such drugs at different medical shops (based on the licenses issued by drug controller) which can be identified by a map. Due to large volume of data, initially a sample size can be determined and taken to calculate the match Sample Data Required, if yes, please describe: Yes Name of CSIR Lab : CSIR – Central Drug Research Institute Nodal Person and Contact Details (Name, Designation, Mobile No. and Email): Dr. Anand Kulkarni, Senior Scientist, CSIR-CDRI Phone: 0522-2772459 Mob: 09451316745 Fax: 0522-2771941 E-mail: anand_kulkarni@cdri.res.in</p>

<h4>Exim traffic map- Live Logistic congestion indicator & logistic planning tool</h4><p>
The time taken for export adds to cost of export, lowers clients’ satisfaction and can be a major risk factor in poor export performance. Live information is not available regarding time being taken at various logistic sectors and routes. Logistic components are serially connected e.g. ICD to railways to port with transit points & transaction functions in between. Congestion and delay at one point has a spiral effect on the chain. Model need to develop to give live information regarding the Exim traffic live and possibly also map cargo routes like the Google traffic map including expected transit time for the cargo via various modes and routes.</p>
 
<h4>Devise a model to capture the components of cost for export – “Cost to export” index</h4><p>
While cost of product is the key component, many costs add to the cost of exported goods. Cost is the most measurable method to gauge impact of economic factor conditions. A model needs to be devised to capture key elements that add to cost of export – post production. Categorization and selection of standardized products from key locations to key ports will enable development of a cost to export index which over a period of time could develop as a barometer index to gauge and plan policy interventions.

<h4>Tool for Transformation of Geodetic Datum’s (Coordinate Systems).</h4><p>
Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to store, retrieve and render the Earth-relative spatial data. GIS deals with flat map projections. Geodetic datum uniquely defines each location on Earth’s surface with coordinates in latitude and longitude. Notable geodetic datum’s are NAD27, NAD83, Everest datum and WGS84. The coordinates for each point on Earth in one geodetic datum is different from other geodetic datum. For example, the latitude and longitude of a location in a Everest datum differs from NAD83 or WGS84. The transformation of one datum to other geodetic datum is known as a datum shift. GIS applications demand the support for more than one geodetic datum’s for both vector and raster maps, hence the datum transformations or datum shift are often necessary. Users of this system: The solution will help Geographic Information System (GIS) based applications which requires different geodetic datum. Technology that can help address the issue: Any high level Program language, Map data handling techniques. Desired Solution : The geodetic datum’s transformation tool should have a provision for input to take map data of one geodetic datum and convert into other geodetic datum for each NAD27, NAD83, Everest datum and WGS84.

Many of the warehouses are located at remote places across PAN India. 2. The internet connectivity provided either through leased line or MPLS or Broadband or 2/3/4G. 3. This type of connectivity comes at high cost or at some places the connectivity is not feasible or weak or fluctuates, which results in non usage of software application at these remote places. Expected deliverables : 1. Low cost IT solution preferably around software controlled devices having capability to host multiple SIMs of different service providers of 2/3/4G Internet service providers. 2. The device considers the 2/3/4G connectivity of one or more SIMs of different service provider, in case their signal strength is adequate. And accordingly provide the uninterrupted internet connectivity to the users at these remote warehouses. 3. Additionally, the device can aggregate the 2/3/4G internet bandwidth of multiple SIMs of different Telecom companies for usage of more software users. Sample data: Can visit warehouses for sampling.</p>

 
<h4>Capture moister, temperature, fire and earth quake related information using sensors and send alerts using IoT technology </h4><p>
Explaining the general problem statement in simple terms: 1. Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) is into scientific storage and handling services for more than 400 commodities include Agricultural produce, Industrial raw-materials, finished goods and variety of hygroscopic and perishable items. 2. Storage loss of food grains and perishables goods are being controlled through quality control practices including periodic chemical treatment , recording of moisture and other parameters, proper documentation , regular inspection , age analysis , sanitation , physical condition of warehouse. 3. Further storage loss due to atmospheric moisture beyond threshold results in infestation etc and hence damages the food grains/perishables. Expected deliverables: 1. Low cost IT solution preferably around Internet of the things (IoT) sensor and IoT data integration to existing application software. The sensor is expected to auto capture the atmospheric moisture and temperature inside the warehouse. 2. Based on moisture and temperature data so captured, the software should do appropriate data analytics and send timely alert to concern officials of CWC for mitigation and remedial actions arising due to moisture and temperature inside the warehouse. 3. Additionally, IoT sensor can also capture fire, earthquake etc and can alert the respective nearest authority like Fire Station, Hospital, and Police besides alerting CWC officials for mitigation.

<h4>Integration with Moisture meter</h4><p>
Explaining the general problem statement in simple terms: i) Moisture plays a very vital role in the daily operations of FCI. With a change in moisture value, computation of storage loss/ gain in food grains gets affected. Hence capturing the moisture value is very essential. ii) Food Corporation of India uses moisture meter (a hardware device) developed by different manufacturers. iii) The readings of the moisture meter are noted manually and are fed into DOS (Depot Online System) iv) Since there is a human intervention, there could be chances that the readings noted are erroneous. v) FCI is looking for a solution where the readings of the moisture meter are captured directly from the moisture meter into DOS or any other software application what FCI is using. vi) The manufacture has to provide the necessary APIs so that they can be integrated with less effort Technology that can address this issue partially: i) Technology to help in identifying the format of the API so that all manufacturers provide the API in the same format so that integration becomes less tedious.</p>

 
<h4>Working on offline-online application and sync the data</h4><p>
Explaining the general problem statement in simple terms: i) Food Corporation of India (FCI) has envisaged to automate all the depot operations. ii) All the automated operations of the depot can be monitored at District office, Regional office, Zonal office and at HQ on a real time basis iii) To achieve the above, FCI has developed Depot Online System (DOS) as a centralized role based web application which is hosted at a centralized location. iv) Using the URL, all the depot users can login and perform their respective activities. v) Few activities that happen at the depot are sequential in manner. It means activity A has to be completed before starting Activity B. Also, some activities can be parallel activities. For example, a token has to be generated at the depot gate before issuing a gate pass. Generation of gate pass is a must before sending the truck to the weighbridge. Similarly, once a truck after having weighed at the weighbridge, enters the depot, dumps the commodity on the dumping platform, the truck can leave the depot after taking the out weight at the weighbridge. Quality related processes of the dumped commodity can happen in parallel. vi) For all the above activities, a token number will be generated based on the type of operation. This token number will be the reference for any subsequent sequential activity or the parallel activities. The completion of the activity or the complete operation can tracked by the token by number. vii) Using the centralized web application, all the above mentioned sequential and parallel processes are achieved when the network strength and access is good viii) When the network strength is bad or no network or centralized application is down, the automated operations at the depot end are to be performed without any hindrance. ix) There needs to be a cost effective and efficient solution where all the sequential and parallel depot operations are captured locally without any loss of data. x) Once the network strength is good or network is restored or centralized application is up, all the locally captured data needs to be synced with the centralized data. xi) The locally hosted application should be intelligent enough to either capture the data locally in case there is no network and should capture the data centrally when the network goes up. xii) In the current implementation, the offline (no network scenario) is captured through excel sheets provided in a prescribed format and these excel sheets gets uploaded to the centralized application once the network is up. This is not a foolproof mechanism and the data entered into the excel sheet could be erroneous. This causes uncertainty and difficulty in getting the real time data. xiii) The solution is required particularly for depot level role users and on an average there will be 6 personnel per depot who will be doing the transactions. Solution should be scalable to all the FCI depots Technology that can address this issue partially: i) A localhost application which captures the data locally and transfers the captured information to the subsequent operations seamlessly. ii) A cost effective solution preferably using open source technologies.

             <h4>DOP network has approximately 30,000 locations across India and divided into Circle. The problem is SLA reporting, SLA calculations, payment processing and payment projection for future.</h4><p>
Current Scenario: 1. DOP has network integrator and his responsibility is to maintain the network. NI vendor responsibility includes: a. Primary network service provider (NSP1) – currently BSNL b. Secondary network service provider (NSP2) – currently Sify c. There may be more NSPs in future d. Managed services to maintain link, network devices 2. There are multiple types of bandwidth a. MPLS, b. Broadband c. Dongle d. There may be other types also. 3. There are different types of offices depending upon number of users. Offices are classified into a. Class A – Very big offices having MPLS connectivity b. Class B – Big Offices having MPLS connectivity c. Class C – Small Offices having MPLS connectivity d. Class D – double hand office having 2 persons with Broadband connectivity e. Class E – Single hand office having 1 person with Broadband connectivity f. Class F – VSAT connectivity where no other means of connectivity is possible. 4. Different bandwidths like 2 Mbps MPLS, 512 Kbps MPLS, 512 Kbps broadband is provisioned depending upon class of offices mentioned at point 3. 5. The SLA reporting frequency is monthly and payment is quarterly to each NSPs and managed services. 6. The SLA reports come from NMS tool and each DOP offices has one unique code. 7. The SLA is different for each NSPs. E.g. a. For NSP1 i. >95% uptime – no penalty, ii. 95% – 90% uptime – 10% of payment deduction. iii. 90% – 80% uptime – 20% of payment deduction. b. Similarly different SLA for NSP2 and calculations would different. 8. The Managed services penalty is applicable if office is isolated means both NSPs are down simultaneously or router is faulty. There may be some other scenarios where DOP location is showing is not operating due to DOP reasons like power, local holidays force majeure etc. 9. The managed services charges are bandwidth-wise and different for each year. 10. The bandwidth of DOP locations are upgraded / downgraded as per requirement and accordingly charges changes from date of commissioning. 11. The SLA and uptime starts from the date of commissioning of DOP location. 12. The bandwidth rate of each NSPs is different for each year. Expected Scenario: a. Which is fully flexible / configurable which can give the expenses till now, , current quarter payment. quarterly projection, yearly projection. b. The software should be role based login: i. So that network integrator can upload the office-wise SLA for each NSPs, managed services. ii. DOP verifier can verify and accept or reject. If accepted it should go to DOP approver and if rejected it will go back network integrator. iii. DOP approver can accept or reject. If accepted then generate MIS report and if rejected then go back to DOP verifier. iv. Reporting and MIS. v. Suitable checks needs to be in place so that users can not amend, delete, add the data. vi. The data should be imported or exported to xls, csv etc. vii. Application should be enterprise level.</p>


<h4>Devising methodology and a system for tackling the flow of data related to mail operations under low bandwidth/failure of network.</h4><p>
Current Scenario: The mail operations right from booking to delivery presently work in an offline mode. The nodes communicate with the central server through a client for exchange of data. The IT modernisation project aims to make all mail operations online. Expected Scenario: The present mail operations of the Department rides on an offline solution, whereby the data resides on local servers and data exchange happens with the central server on a set frequency. The ongoing IT Modernisation project intends to integrate the entire mail operations right from booking to delivery into an online process. Since the entire system rides on a sturdy network and given a situation when the network fails, the communication of data (various scans of articles viz. booking, dispatch, receipt, bagging etc) may not get communicated. The Department needs a light IT solution whereby key functionalities of the IT system are run on a mobile or tablet , so that the same may be used to carry out the work as an interim and push the data into the central server using low bandwidth. Alternatively, a system may be developed to capture the data in an offline mode and push the same into the servers as an when the internet connectivity resumes.</p>

 
<h4>Mechanisation of parcel sorting at parcel processing centres (parcel hubs)</h4><p>
Current Scenario: The Departmental sorting facilities have traditionally been aligned to handling documents and small packets. The existing parcel sorting happens manually either on floor area or on conveyer belts at select locations. The entire parcel processing does not have any Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which brings down the sorting efficiency. Expected Scenario: The Department is in the process of mechanising the sorting of parcels at its sorting facilities. Mechanisation has commenced with use of conveyor belts, pin code based primary sorting (through backend integration with barcode) and DWMS (Dimension and Weight Measuring System). At the primary sort level, articles are sorted into groups of range of PIN codes to be sorted further (secondary sort) and bagged for destination hubs. The secondary sort requires a skilled sorter to find the correct destination bag. Can the secondary sorter is guided by the system itself as to which bag the article has to be dropped? Can the article be scanned and a light over the appropriate bag come on using PTL (Put to Light) solution? A prototype solution may be provided which should be scalable for number of sorts that may range from 30-90 destinations.
</p>
 
<h4>Design and demonstrate a digital addressing system as an extension of the existing PIN code</h4><p>
Current Scenario: The existing limited address database has merely the physical addresses. The data base lacks geo-spatial information and any standardised format of addressing. Expected Scenario: The Department is in the process of developing a digital address database for the entire country. A digital address database means that the physical address of any location is to be complemented by its geo-coordinates, both of which have to be mapped together. The digital address may be an alpha-numeric code or otherwise, and shall have to be an extension of the existing PIN code system which defines the delivery jurisdiction of a post office. Latest GIS technology, along with data analytics need to come together to develop the digital address database. The database format, manner of data collection of physical addresses and layering it with geo coordinates etc. need to be decided.</p>


<h4>Design of parcel drop off kiosk and integration with the present Departmental software ecosystem which is offline as well as the proposed online ecosystem</h4><p>
Current Scenario: Customers have to book their articles (Speed Post, Registered Post, and Parcels- Express & Business) at the Post Office counters. The bulk customers and e-commerce players book their articles/parcels either at the Business Post Centres operating at select post offices or at dedicated parcel booking centres. Expected Scenario: The Department is soon going to make its web portal transactional to enable web based booking of retail and bulk articles such as Speed Post, Registered Post etc. Once booked, the article has to either be picked up or dropped off at identified locations to be physically inducted into the system for processing. At the time of induction, the weight of the article has to be validated to prevent any leakage of revenue. For the customer, the process of dropping-off should be as hassle-free and take minimal time. A kiosk with necessary IT support to enable the above and allowing for making payment (in case of additional tariff to be paid) or having the amount credited (in case of higher tariff paid) is required.</p>

 
<h4>Cost calculation system for products which have to travel across multiple offices</h4><p>
Current Scenario: The existing cost calculation is based on some random / sample assessments/studies done very long back. There is significant change in the product portfolio of the Department since then. As different products are handled by the same operator/office, there is no cost segregation for each service/product. Expected Scenario: Arriving at the cost of the product/service where the stakeholders are from different offices spread across the length and breadth of the country</p>

 
<h4> End to End mapping of Network to arrive at the expected time of delivery</h4><p>
Current Scenario: Currently there is no mapping available in the system. However, based on the geographical areas like metro cities/state capitals etc and also based on the Circle boundaries, time limits are prescribed in Citizen Charter for delivery of articles. Due to non availability of accurate mapping of entire network and routing channel, there are no standard delivery norms between one post office to another post office Expected Scenario: To map entire chain of Post Offices and Sorting hubs so as estimate the probable date of delivery at the time of booking itself.
</p>
 
<h4>Digital Addressee System with Unique address for each addressee location</h4><p>
Current Scenario: No such database now. However, while booking mail articles/money orders etc., complete address of the addressee/payee is captured and stored in the database. But this data is not used for any purpose once the article/money order is delivered/paid. Building a digital addressee system based on the above data could not be materialized. Expected Scenario: Post Office should be able to build its own digital addressee system. Building a preliminary digital addressee system based on the data available with various government agencies and then enhancing /updating the same from the addressee data being captured (as mentioned in above para)</p>

 
<h4>Load management for transport planning</h4><p>
Current Scenario: There is no Transport management system in place. Therefore, the proposed load to be handled in ensuing 2-3 days could not be foreseen till the same is received at Sorting Office/Post Office. This results in poor resource management which ultimately increases costs due to last minute planning and significantly lowers the efficiency. Expected Scenario: 1) Smart planning for low costs by combining the shipments, based on the carrier’s capacity 2) Advance Information of the load across the supply chain</p>

<h4>IP Data Analysis and priority queuing</h4><p>
Problem Statement SATCOM networks operate on proprietary data formats, protocols being used by different vendors. In order to effectively utilize the network during emergency, we need to analyze the data after demodulation and isolate the various types of traffic namely voice, video and data. Subsequently we also need to prioritize the data at which is being fed to the VSAT modems as per flexible set of rules, e.g. the voice being given maximum priority, the private data being next and then multimedia data. Data rate surge in low priority services should not affect quality of high priority services.

<h4>Formation Flying Simulation for UAV Image Acquisition with Real Time Control</h4><p>
Problem Statement Currently remote sensing imagery gathered by UAVs, drones or other low altitude unmanned flying vehicles suffer from some limitations like: • No redundancy – only one vehicle used to acquire images. If it fails then the whole activity is rendered useless • Resolution/image capture range limited to view capabilities of vehicle i.e. the vehicle can only capture images of a fixed maximum area say 1km x 1km • Inability to view targets from multiple angles simultaneously in a single flight • Manual control is restricted to line of sight operation i.e. the vehicle can only be controlled if there is an unobstructed line of sight between the vehicle and the controller To resolve these problems, we can devise a system that incorporates multiple UAV vehicles in a master slave fashion (only one master, any vehicle can be assigned as master). Following are the details: • Redundant operation is possible due to presence of multiple vehicles even if one fails, then others are there to act as backups • High resolution possible due to combined resolution of master and slaves (by maintaining fixed/variable separation) that is to say where one vehicle could only capture images of say 1km x 1km, multiple vehicles together can capture 1km x 5km thus increasing the range of image capture as an example • Multilook/Multiangle acquisition possible for given targets i.e. the same target can be simultaneously photographed from more than one angle. This can help in 3D image generation • In case the master (or for that matter any of the vehicles) goes out of line of sight control during manual operation due to presence of trees/buildings etc., then another vehicle (in LoS) can be made the master and the ‘unreachable’ vehicle can be controlled through the new master Desired Outcome A UAV formation flying simulation that can address the above mentioned limitations of single UAV operation and perform a successful fly through over a given area Dataset SRTM or ASTER digital elevation maps can be provided for a given region to generate the terrain over which the formation flying simulation is to be carried out ( https://nrsc.gov.in/hackathon2018/) Domain Software development (desktop based) Challenge Formulating a technique to arrange and operate simulated UAVs in a master slave fashion Usage Massively increasing the capabilities of UAV image acquisition process.

<h4>Distributed Panorama Construction of High Resolution UAV Imagery Using Public Compute Nodes</h4><p>
Problem Statement The raw remote sensing/optical imagery captured by UAVs almost always needs to be processed for generating a region panorama using image stitching. The image stitching procedure generally involves various steps namely: • Feature detection for finding correspondences between images so that they may be considered for alignment • Image calibration for removing optical defects such as distortions, chromatic aberrations etc. • Image registration that involves feature matching to determine optimal alignment features • Image blending that involves executing the adjustments figured out in the calibration stage, combined with remapping of the images to an output projection However, these images are typically of gigantic sizes due to which processing them takes a significant amount of time and hardware based computational resources. This leads to cumulative delays in preparation of the imagery data in a format that is useful for scientific or public use. Thus after determining those steps which do not have dependencies on the other steps of processing, the images can be divided into chunks of small size (say a few KBs) and these can be distributed among the devices owned by common people such as smartphones, or even desktops. An app/software will utilize the resources of the mobile or desktop to perform processing on the small image chunk and send the results back to the servers. At the server end, the processed chunks are assembled together to get the final output for that processing stage. Desired Outcome Panorama constructed from unstitched UAV images utilizing algorithms that have to work in a distributed fashion to produce the final image Dataset Unstitched UAV images acquired for the North East Indian region will be provided https://nrsc.gov.in/hackathon2018/ Domain Software development (app and desktop based) Challenge Expansion of existing image stitching techniques to work in a distributed environment and formulation of algorithms for the same Usage Provides a very easy way of distributing the work/effort required to process huge UAV images.

<h4>Estimating path profile of rain rate from point rainfall and total path attenuation data</h4><p>
Problem Statement Ka band satellite signals are highly attenuated by rain. For a satellite signal, extended from the ground receiver to the satellite, the total attenuation is the path integral of the specific attenuation (attenuation per unit length) along the path under the rain height. The specific attenuation profile, in turn, is dependent upon the path profile of the rain rate. However, it is practical to measure the rain rates at only one location. Since the rain rate is spatially variable, this point measurement of rain rate cannot be readily used for estimating the total rain attenuation for a signal path. The problem expects development of a statistical function for the path profile of rain rate as a function of the given point rain rate and the total rain attenuation over the path in a definite frequency. This may be done for any particular location of the satellite and ground receiver over Indian region. The expression for specific attenuation in terms of the rain rate will be provided. The event wise spatial variation of rain rate, available in the open sources may be used to obtain the directional spatial correlation for such modelling. Datasets https://nrsc.gov.in/hackathon2018/ Domain SATCOM Link Designing Challenge The challenge lies in appropriately functionalizing the direction and location sensitive rain rate profiles for given rain point rain rate and finding out the appropriate statistics.

<h4>New Position Estimation Algorithm using range differences from satellites</h4><p>
Problem Statement Navigation receivers for GPS, NavIC etc. use known satellite positions and ranges from these satellites to receivers to determine its position and time. The current position estimation algorithm uses linearization technique for such estimation, which considers only first order variations of range and solves using iterative operation. Further, the ranges measured at the receivers are contaminated by the common receiver clock bias. This demands additional mandatory requirement of finding the clock bias while solving for position. A new algorithm for estimating receiver position may be developed which uses differences in ranges from different satellites to the receiver (rather than using absolute ranges). Differencing the ranges obtained from two different satellites at the same instant will eliminate the clock error from the variables used for estimation. The algorithm should (i) estimate the unknown receiver coordinates without any approximation, (ii) provide variances in the estimation process in terms of variances in range measurements. Datasets https://nrsc.gov.in/hackathon2018/ Domain Satellite Navigation Service Challenge The challenge lies in selecting the optimal way for handling the consequent three dimensional hyperbolic equations with minimum operations and without making the process computation intensive.

<h4> Geofencing of data on NavIC/IRNSS signals</h4><p>
Problem Statement The Indian satellite navigation systems include the regional primary navigation system, NavIC and the augmentation system, GAGAN. These systems use message based signal structure, where every message transmitted is fixed in length and has its own identified message ID. Apart from carrying the navigation messages, the currently unused message IDs may be used for transmitting text information for the purpose of disaster warning, location based services etc. Further, the information may be geofenced. A geo-fence is a virtual perimeter for a real geographic area. The use of a geo-fence is called geofencing. A location-aware device can be geofenced such that it is able to read and display a transmitted message only within a given defined boundary. This facility is disabled on the receiver exiting the geo-fence. This project involves development of framework for total end to end information flow with geofencing facility. It should include (i) the data structuring in the message, (ii) message priority estimation, (ii) selection of appropriate encryption, (iii) authentication techniques, etc. (iv) Further, a software module to be developed that identifies, decrypts and displays the text information, with a simulated structured message as input. The geofence boundary will be provided such that the decryption ability will toggle inside and outside of it. Deliverable A full fledge application which demonstrates end to end message dissemination in controlled manner. Datasets https://nrsc.gov.in/hackathon2018/ Domain Satellite Navigation services Challenge The challenge lies in proper selection of the key steps in designing a message structure, like data formatting, choice of encryption protocol, optimized placement of key elements in the message, etc. Also, precisely estimating the inclusion/exclusion within the geofence and enabling the key sensitive to the geo location is also challenging. Usage Dissemination of important information, to different categories of users based upon their locations. Therefore, key use will be for disaster warning applications and LBS.

<h4>Optimal Connectivity of Unconnected Villages through Roads in Rural Area (Uttarakhand)</h4><p>
Problem Statement 1. At present there are so many villages in the country which are not connected with metaled roads. 2. For providing better road transport facility and to access village resources for economic development in a better way, the connectivity of every eligible village through all-weather roads is very much required. 3. Rural road connectivity is a critical component in the socio-economic development of rural India by providing access to amenities like transport, education, health, marketing, etc. 4. There is a nationwide centrally sponsored scheme of Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India namely ‘Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) (http://pmgsy.nic.in)’. In this yojana, the officials of Ministry of rural development are selecting un-metaled roads between villages and nearest district/state highways as per the proposals of Gram Pradhan or block development officer but not using Technology for selecting these un-metaled roads (which are to be converted into metaled roads) for optimization of total road length and hence the government expenditure. 5.

<h4>Efficient Indexing for Spatial-temporal Data in GIS Environment</h4><p>
Problem Statement Advancement of Location based services (LBS), IOT (internet of things) and ubiquitous computing devices and high temporal and spatial resolution satellite data acquisition has started flooding enormous data. In order to analyze these data in GIS environment, the challenge is for faster execution of complicated GIS algorithms and tools. There are many GIS tools which cannot directly handle large size spatio-temporal data due to limited memory. To handle large size data, first data is stored in database and then it is accessed by the GIS tools. Access is usually made faster by making indexing in the database. Efficient indexing technique for spatial-temporal data would in fact can reduce the execution time of these programs many folds. In GIS there are two kind of data- Raster Data (Images) and Vector Data (Geometry). Vector data can be of point, line and polygon. Indexing technique should be able to handle point, line and polygon. Should be optimized at least for point data. If possible, should be extendable to support Raster (Student may design different indexing technique for raster and vector data). Desired Outcome • A program library (or API) to create in memory spatio-temporal index on geospatial data. o Optimized for nearest neighbor and Intersection search in Space-time domain. o Should support multi-dimensional (dimensions excluding space and time) indexing • Example program in python (preferable) using the developed API and comparing the results o using spatio-temporal data with and without using index o using spatio-temporal data with respect to using RTree index (only spatial index) o using only spatial data with and without index • using only spatial data with respect to using RTree index Challenge • Most of the spatial database have efficient indexing technique developed for handling spatial data and attribute data. Challenge is to develop single indexing for both space and time. • Most of the GIS tools are designed to access data directly from the source file like (tiff image, GML, csv or .shp file). Challenge is to design/implement in-memory indexing technique for spatio-temporal data, so that it can be directly incorporated into existing GIS algorithms.

<h4>To develop a mathematical tool for station-keeping of halo orbits with minimum fuel consumption.</h4><p>
Problem Statement Assume that a satellite is moving on a L1-halo orbit of Sun-Earth system in CRTBP. Due to perturbation forces satellite will not follow the reference trajectory as initial halo orbits are designed with simplified mathematical models. Due to this, satellite deviates from the reference trajectory path and to overcome this situation a station keeping strategy is required which can keep the satellite within the desired torus. So a mathematical tool is required to plane the maneuver strategy with optimal (minimum) fuel consumption. The reference orbit is provided in the form of data file. Actual orbit can be obtained by introducing some perturbations in the position and velocity of the satellite at some instant and then propagating the state in future by using the new perturbed state as the initial position and velocity.

<h4>To design the transfer trajectory from earth parking orbit to halo orbit in the Sun-Earth circular restricted three body problem (CRTBP) using differential corrector.</h4><p>
Problem Statement Assume that a satellite is revolving around Earth in a 200 200 km circular parking orbit. Our objective is to transfer the satellite from the Earth parking orbit to Sun-Earth L1-halo orbit. Stable manifolds of halo orbits provide a natural way to transfer the satellite but it takes more time than the desired time and also does not pass to the desired altitude. Like by using manifolds the transfer trajectory takes around 328 days from Earth parking orbit to halo orbit. Hence it is desired to apply some other mathematical tool to design the transfer trajectory. Differential corrector with manifolds can be a suitable way to design the transfer trajectory. A circular restricted three body problem model can be considered for this study. A transfer trajectory is provided in the form of data file. But this trajectory passes at an altitude of around 5100 km from the Earth surface. Hence it need to correct to pass at an altitude of 200 km to touch the desired parking orbit.

<h4>The present guidelines of DoT HQ do not allow more than nine mobile connections to an individual.</h4><p>
Thus, it implies that even the connections have been obtained from different Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), the cumulative count should not exceed nine. Since there is no connectivity among the different TSPs’ subscriber databases therefore the TSPs are bound to limit the query within their own database to ensure that the new connection which is going to be activated does not cross the above count. There is no mechanism with TSP to check the no. of connections working for that individual with other TSPs. Expected Outcome An app and web application may be developed through which anyone can query the combined mobile subscriber databases of all the TSPs in a Licensed Service Area (LSA) so that- (i)Any citizen can know the list of mobile connections working against her/ his Aadhaar number in an LSA. This information should be provided in an authentic manner only to actual Aadhaar allottee. (ii) DoT can know the list of mobile connections working against a particular Aadhaar number in an LSA. The application should also be capable of generating the list of those mobile connections, count of which are more than a specific number for a particular Aadhaar number. Additional Information DoT requires each TSP to provide mobile subscriber data in a predefined format at regular intervals. Thus, solution to this problem should consider merging data from all the TSPs</p>

         <h4>Creating an Automatic Pitch Deck Creator</h4><p>
A lot of Startups find it very difficult to present themselves as a potential opportunity for investment and mobilize funds from investors and banks. Entrepreneurs also do not have an idea about what banks are looking for and end up losing funding opportunities. A technology solution is required that would help educate entrepreneurs on how to prepare financials to propose to a bank for funds and further create a template where startups can put in there data in a format which could be accessed by any investor who wants to fund startups. Hence, there is a need to standardize and automate the process of creating a pitch deck – whereby the user feeds in the inputs asked by the platform, and in the end as an output – there is a standardized business plan that comes up. Sample list of inputs required for automating the pitch deck: • Problem Addressed • Product/Service Description • Market Size • Customer segment • Competition – Other Players, USP, Customer Retention Strategy etc. • Revenue Model • Scalability of solution • Current financials and projections • Requirement of funds & valuation • Team Composition etc. 5.1 Synopsis The platform should capture the following: • Automatically check the information that needs to be covered in a pitch deck • Ask user for information required to create a pitch deck including but not limited to: o Problem addressed o Product / Service description o Market size o Customer segmentation o Competition: Other players, USP, Customer retention strategy etc. o Revenue model o Scalability of solution o Current financials and projections o Requirement of funds and valuation o Team Composition • Output a standardised and cohesive pitch deck 5.2 Additional information on the problem statement 5.2.1 Terminology- KEY WORDS Term / Acronym Meaning Business Plan A business plan is a formal statement of business goals, reasons they are attainable, and plans for reaching them. Pitch Deck Pitch deck is a presentation usually used to give your audience a snapshot of your business plan Market Size The number of individuals in a certain market who are potential buyers and/or sellers of a product or service. Customer Segmentation Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing. USP A unique selling proposition (USP) refers to the unique benefit exhibited by a company, service, product or brand Customer Retention Strategy Customer Retention Strategy is about keeping the customers you’ve invested in to acquire. Revenue model A revenue model is a framework for generating revenues. Scalability Scalability is the capability to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. CLV:CAC Ratio Customer Lifetime Value : Customer Acquisition Cost Customer Lifetime Value is the prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. Customer Acquisition Cost CAC can be calculated by simply dividing all the costs spent on acquiring more customers (marketing expenses) by the number of customers acquired in the period the money was spent. Current Financials & Projections Financial projection is a forecast of future revenues and expenses Valuation Financial value of the company Team Composition Team composition refers to the overall mix of characteristics among people in a team, which is a unit of two or more individuals who interact interdependently to achieve a common objective. 5.2.2 Existing process/method in practice Current process Manual / Semi-Automatic Who are the people responsible for creation of Pitch Decks? Generally, the founders / co-founders of a company or aspiring entrepreneurs are responsible for the creation of pitch decks. What information is currently included in a pitch deck? The creators of the pitch deck decide which materials to include in the pitch deck. Hence there is no standardization of material. How are pitch decks designed? Third party designers or existing templates are used for design purposes. What platforms are used in the creation of Pitch Decks? Platforms used popularly include PowerPoint and keynote. Furthermore, templates are available on the internet 5.2.3 Challenges with current system Challenge Impact / Inconvenience caused Lack of standardization of information included in pitch decks Prevents investors from being able to effectively compare different startups based on common metrics and information. Different startups may use different categorizations and terminologies to present similar information. Lack of knowledge regarding information to be included in pitch decks. All aspects of a pitch deck may not be included in the pitch deck and information may be partial or incomplete. Lack of Design and Flow in the pitch deck Pitch decks are improperly designed and are unable to present information effectively 5.2.4 Users (staff members) involved in the current (and possibly new) system and their responsibilities, system access privileges User Role Access level, responsibilities, remarks Access: View + Edit Platform Responsibilities: Develop and design the pitch deck automation platform Constantly and consistently update platform with the objectives of making it more user friendly and faster. 5.2.5 Break-down of the challenges into smaller logical operations: NOT REQUIRED 5.3 Identify all subsystems and interactions among them Link for some sample pitch decks: Pitch Decks Figure 1: Information to be presented on Pitch Deck 5.4 Technical feasibility: NOT REQUIRED 5.5 Desired outcome of the solution to be built The problem of standardization and inconsistency of information in pitch decks will be solved fully with the help of an automated pitch deck creator since all users will be prompted to enter a given set of information. Moreover, the pitch deck will be designed automatically and information will be presented in a logical and sequent

         <h4> Technology to enable seamless marketing of agri commodities beyond the current geographic clusters</h4><p>
1 Technology to enable seamless marketing of agri commodities beyond the current geographic clusters. GOI aimed to achieve this through the eNAM but most trades on eNAM are only intra mandi trades. Grading and fulfilment are critical if marketing of agriculture trades has to start happening between mandis that are far apart. In this context, models like Kalgudi which offer a model of gratification/accreditation (which is common on most e-marketplaces like Amazon, Uber, etc) can be a pathbreaking alternative. 2 Technology backed solutions to deliver a more engaged and learning based capacity building programs to extension workers and farmers. A lot of private sector research is happening in MOOCs to improve learning outcomes for primary school students. Farmer and Extension worker specific effective learning programs should be developed.</p>

 
<h4>Translate weather information to very actionable advisory to farmers</h4><p>
1. Solutions to translate weather information (LT forecast, Weather outlook and 7-day weather forecast) to very actionable advisory to farmers. This can really play a major role in building climate resilience of farmers. 2. Technology solutions to improve traceability in both Agri input supply chains (especially for seeds) and for Agriculture outputs. Technologies like block chains can really help make this a reality 3. Technology solutions that can help crop insurance achieve faster claims processing and settlement. As of today, GOI still uses CCEs to assess crop damage and trigger settlements. There are plenty of moral hazards with CCEs and there is no incentive for farmer to put in good efforts. Can there be a technology based workflow solution that incentivizes good behavior and also can trigger on-demand scalable assessments of crop damage (Possibly drones could be a good technology).</p>

 
<h4>Real time identification of crops, weeds, diseases and pest damage and nutrient deficiency symptoms</h4><p>
Development of an app for identification of crops, weeds, diseases and pest damage and nutrient deficiency symptoms. The app should have user selection features such that: Item to identify – Crop, Weed, Pest damage, disease damage, nutrient deficiency. The app should have access to the devise’s camera. The developers should have an extensive database of photos of Crops, weeds, other plants, trees, symptoms in the leaves that has been caused by pests, diseases and also typical examples of major and minor nutrient deficiency symptoms. The app should have the algorithms for object detection, and image classification Pattern recognition algorithms should be developed to provide a close match for all possible inputs and further get the most likely matching of the inputs. There can also be a pattern matching algorithms, to look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns.</p>

 
<h4>Identify quality index of the fruit/vegetable by non-destructive or with minimal destructive methods</h4><p>
The fruits and vegetables are the perishable products. It is important that the consumers know about the quality status of the product they are buying from the market. The seller should also know the status of product quality to avoid selling of the bad quality product to the consumer. So, a device can be developed with appropriate sensors that can show the quality index of the fruit/vegetable by non-destructive or with minimal destructive methods.
</p>

<h4>Development of a multilingual Mobile App for deep sea fishermen</h4><p>
A mobile App MKrishi@fishereis has been developed by the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Kochi to aid marine fishermen of the country. The App provides multilingual information on Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ), sea surface temperature, weather and also helps the fishermen in knowing the wind speed and direction and wave heights. However, this Mobile App has some limitations as it can be used only up to a range of 30 km radius from the shore line and the deep sea fishermen who normally venture farther into the ocean are unable to get real time information during fishing operations in the deeper waters of Indian EEZ. This Mobile App can be further enhanced by increasing the range of operation so that it can be made use of by the deep sea fishermen of the country who venture into deeper and farther areas from the coast. The Mob App should also include additional information like Global Positioning System (GPS) indicating real time position, movement and distance covered by the vessel and should provide a means of communication so that the fishermen are able to have regular contact with other boats and shore for their safety.
</p>
 
<h4>Marketing network for agricultural commodities for the benefit of producer and consumer</h4><p>
Usually the agricultural produce is purchased from the farmers at a low price and sold to the consumers at relatively very high price because of a large number of middlemen involved. Direct contact between the farmer and retail seller or wholesaler can reduce the number of middlemen involved in the marketing chain. A mobile based App that can facilitate the direct contact between producer (farmer) and buyer may reduce this wide price gap or a real time interactive system for communication between farmers and Mandis.</p>

 
<h4>Forewarning system for disease/pest attack for different commodities in different agro-climatic zones</h4><p>
Farmers generally face problem with disease/pest attack on different varieties. Over the period of time, the severity has increased and resulted in losses of crop. An intelligent system can be attempted with modern analytical tools to support in timely forewarning and remedial measures for the same. System should issue advisory with sms alert in local languages. System should have provision for real time expert advise as an when required in some interactive manner.</p>

<h4>To develop an instrument which could identify the taste</h4><p>
Many of the therapeutic actions of Ayurvedic medicines are explained by the taste of the medicine / herb. For example, Guduchi – Indian Tinospora acts as anti-fever herb, because of its bitter taste. So, taste in Ayurveda is not only meant for explain it as a feature, but it is also a tool to explain pharmacology (how a medicine acts). Hence there is a need a bio equipment which could access the taste of the Drug/Food.</p>


<h4>To develop an conversion scale which would convert the scaled mentioned in Ayurveda into modern day measures</h4><p>
An conversion scale which would convert the scaled mentioned in Ayurveda into modern day measures. Table of metric equivalents of weights and measures, linear measures and measurement of time used in the Ayurvedic classics have been approved by the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia committee in consultation with Indian Standards Institution.</p>

 
<h4>To develop a non-invasive method for measuring blood glucose and Hb levels</h4><p>
Currently, blood glucose and haemoglobin can only be monitored through the use of invasive techniques. The risk of infection and measurement inaccuracy are present with all of the invasive techniques. In addition, discomfort also caused by the invasive method. A truly non-invasive glucose and haemoglobin-sensing device could avoid complications of diabetes and anemia. Non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose offers many advantages, which avoid pain and discomfort from frequent finger-pricking.</p>

<h4>Development of a vulnerability scanner</h4><p>
The vulnerability scanner should automatically parse through the APIs to identify which ones may be exposing the system to danger. A vulnerability database is the list of known vulnerabilities the scanner will use to spot potential problems the more information the scanner has, the more accurate its performance. Once a team has a report of the vulnerabilities, developers can use penetration testing as a means to see where the weaknesses are, so the problem can be fixed and future mistakes can be avoided. When employing frequent and consistent scanning, one will start to see common threads between the vulnerabilities for a better understanding of the full system.

While applying for different recruitments through online application softcopy uploading of documents like educational qualification, D.O.B proof, category certificate etc. of candidate is required. This result in unnecessary utilization of server space as each application requires approx. 2MB storage space and thousands of applications are received. If credentials are verified then & there at the time of application receiving (uploading), it will be beneficial for all stakeholders. Integration solution with generic interface is needed.

<h4>Masking user details on the mobile while transacting And Establishing if a cardholder is shopping from a recognised payment device</h4><p>
The primary concern from a corporate governance perspective is that personnel conducting work in these non-production environments are not always security cleared to operate with the information contained in the production data. This practice represents a security hole where data can be copied by unauthorised personnel and security measures associated with standard production level controls can be easily bypassed. This represents an access point for a data security breach. To protect data that is classified as personal identifiable data, personal sensitive data or commercially sensitive data, however the data must remain usable for the purposes of undertaking valid test cycles. It must also look real and appear consistent.</p>

             <h4> Developing an automatic instrument to record call of specific bird and weather parameters in a location</h4><p>
The Problem: Monitoring and assessing the population of nocturnal birds (for example: owls) is a big challenge for the researchers due to their nocturnal nature and the presence of wild animals (for example: elephants and bear) in the tropical forests like the Western Ghats. The available recorders in the market records all the sound that is being produced around the recorder and it is usually dominated by insects and that might affect the data quality. Hence, we need an automatic instrument that could record only tailor-made frequency and amplitude of sounds by excluding other noises. Furthermore, their vocalization frequency is strongly influenced by the local weather conditions such as atmospheric temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, noise level and moon status. Thus, the instrument should record and store sounds and weather parameters. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Automatic sound recording systems, spectrogram, nocturnal birds, voice and calls of birds Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge. The recorder should identify and capture only the frequency and amplitude range that matches with the target species’ range and should store data with all relevant weather information for each sequences. The instrument can’t be kept operational throughout the night as it consumes lot of energy and storage. The instrument may activate recording upon hearing the specified range of sounds. Users who are facing the challenge/sub-problem could use data. Forest managers, biodiversity scientists, researchers involved in study and conservation of nocturnal birds Any record keeping databases/ legacy systems or integrations that need to be considered Not Applicable. Required channel – mobile app, responsive web, web application, desired. Hardware solution. Desired outcome if the challenge is addressed The instrument if developed will help the researchers to monitor the population of nocturnal birds and bats (can be modified) in the elephant areas. This will also help the researchers to take up large-scale surveys on nocturnal birds with limited funding and man-power. Details pertaining to the scale of the problem The number of users may be low but it is an important contribution to the concerned group of researchers.

<h4>A real time recording and monitoring of human activities and animal movements in Protected Areas</h4><p>
The Problem: Poaching is a major problem for wildlife managers across the world. The increasing demand for wildlife meat, fur, skin and organs increases the poaching across the globe. India supports a great majority of biodiversity. Protection and conservation of this biological wealth is a challenging task for many wildlife managers. Shortage of human resources esp. the field staff and scarce availability of logistics and resources make wildlife preservation a daunting task. Hence we seek to develop a user friendly application for wildlife managers and field level staffs to record and communicate the field level information during patrolling and surveillance movemnts in the forest. The wildlife sightings, deaths, wild life crime and ecological observations, human presence can be recorded with GPS coordinates while patrolling. The patrol routes of forest guards can be recorded using the mobile application. Producing a map after each patrol will help to understand the overall picture of the day’s work. A timely consolidation of these maps will help to get an overall idea of the animal movements and human activities in the protected area and hence the managers can develop strategic plans for reducing the poaching. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Wildlife movement, Poaching, Conservation, protected area Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge. Developing a mobile application for collecting the data from the field and online reporting during the patrolling has to be made.

<h4>Warning and emergency response system to prevent human elephant conflict through acoustic monitoring of movement of Elephants</h4><p>
The Problem: The settlements and farmlands in hill areas are more prone to wildlife conflicts. Elephant crop raiding is very common in most of these places. An average of 300 human mortality by elephants are reported annually from India. The shrinking habitats, increasing human invasion in the forest areas and increase in population size of elephants leadsto resource scarcity. Elephants are attracted to agricultural crops due to their higher nutritional value. However, the types of crops grown, the season of ripening, location of agricultural fields and migration patterns, all contribute to the intensity of crop raiding. The increasing trend in human elephant conflict shows that we fail to manage this issue. In this scenario implementing a software which can give an awareness or warning to the local people about the movement of elephants in forest fringing areas by detecting the infrasound communication of elephants using acoustic sensors can be a best way to reduce the human elephant conflict. Here we seek a digital solution made for a hypothetical forest fringing area which can be customized to various location for implementation. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Acoustic monitoring of elephant movements, Human elephant conflict, warning and awareness system. Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge. Infrasound detecting sensors have to be developed. Distance calculating digital protocol.

<h4>Digital solution to predict drought in a protected area/locality</h4><p>
Problem: Drought or scarcity of water for the wild animals during summer is one of the major management issues in the forests of the Country. In spite of two seasons of monsoons in the Country, most of the streams and rivers in the forest areas will become dry by January – February posing severe threat to the animals as well as vegetation made vulnerable to forest fire. It would be appreciated if a digital tool is developed to predict the water scarcity in an area, sometimes as small as size of a range of 1000 ha, with the help of available physiographical data and local weather information. Local weather information such as rainfall, number of rainy days, average rainfall per day, average minimum and maximum temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and physiographical data such as aspect, type of vegetation, percentage canopy, soil type, etc. can be included Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking: Drought, humidity, canopy cover, solar radiation, water scarcity, soil type, aspect Sub problems which needs to be resolved or form key part of the challenges Development of simple model to predict the drought or water scarcity in a locality based on sample data on various parameters mentioned above Managing parameters such as Water holding capacity of the soil Evapotranspiration under different situations (varying canopy cover, temperature, and duration of solar radiation, etc) Users who are facing the challenge/sub-problem could use data State Forests and Wildlife Departments Any record keeping data base/ legacy systems or integrations that need to be considered Local weather data available with the forest management Google image of the landcover/any other landcover map for the area Any other information available on natural resources of the area Required channel – mobile app, responsive web, web application, desired.

<h4>Digital solution to document, analyse and manage biodiversity and environmental problems of the wetlands</h4><p>
The Problem: Wetlands serve as source of water for majority population in our country. The culture of wetland management has been inherent throughout centuries past until recently. India harbours many Ramsar sites – wetlands of international importance, and at the same time, innumerous small wetlands, temporary and permanent are neglected. These are widely encroached upon by land filling and other methods which have blocked the natural draining system of a town/city. After understanding the importance of wetlands in ground water replenishment and harbouring biodiversity, recently, orders from the higher judiciary have been passed to monitor and conserve smaller local wetlands. For effective conservation of these wetlands, a biodiversity database over time along with the status of the wetland throughout the year needs to be monitored and then adaptive management plans need to be made. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Wetlands, Ramsar sites, marshes, bhogs, jheels, databases, digital management plans, Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge. Wetland area/ water quality and biodiversity databases to be developed in real time and integrated with a data management system Simple statistical analysis of these databases for effective management plans. An enquiry based information dissemination system. Users who are facing the challenge/sub-problem could use data Panchayat and Corporation officers, Scientists, Town planners, Forest department Any record keeping databases/ legacy systems or integrations that need to be considered All available wetland data from the websites of Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Envis Centre at SACON, Bombay Natural History Society can be considered Required channel – mobile app, responsive web, web application, desired. Web application, responsive web Desired outcome if the challenge is addressed The regularly updated information availability for conservation and management intervention. This will save a lot of time in bringing in effective management plans for wetlands. In turn will save costs of assessing wetlands prior to each step in managing them. Details pertaining to the scale of the problem There are around 55,000 natural wetlands in the country that are documented. It is believed that many more smaller wetlands may not have been documented. The management plans derived from the digital solution will prove useful in protecting and using natural wetlands sustainably.

<h4>Developing vehicle speed warning system and wildlife detection systems to avoid wildlife-vehicle collisions</h4><p>
The Problem: Road kill is a major threat to wildlife. From elephants to the smallest reptiles, snakes, and frogs, irrespective of animal size no species is spared on the oads that pass through forests. These cases are much more frequent along highways as most vehicles travel at great speed (≥ 80 km/hr). Despite the advance in vehicular technology there hasn’t yet been a safety solution to this problem. There are no safety measures that enable vehicles to detect the approaching wildlife species along the road. Here we seek the development of a smart and highly sensitive detection system in built in vehicles to prevent unnecessary wildlife-vehicle collisions. The most challenging part of the system is for the device to detect not just large sized mammals (≥ 50 kgs) but to also detect extremely small sized species weighing barely a few grams (< 500 gms). The solution should involve a detector that can detect small and large wildlife species on the road which sends a warning to the vehicle to slow down. In addition the speed detection and warning systems should be placed every 1 km along road sides to record the speed, time, date, and photos of incoming vehicles. This device should be interfaced at various forest checkposts and range offices to allow immediate action taken against overspeeding vehicles that are responsible for the road kill. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Speed detectors, speed warning system, vehicle-wildlife collision, and animal body size detection Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge. Development of sensors to identify an animal on the road Sensors to calculate the vehicle speed and give warning to appropriate centre. The technology should identify the vehicle that has caused the road kill.

<h4>Developing video based sensor technological network to address human–wildlife conflict and poaching in and around Protected Areas</h4><p>
The Problem: Dramatic increases in human-large mammal conflict in recent years results from an exponential increase in human populations. Ever expanding human pressure in India has caused a decline in many large mammalian species through the loss of habitat for agriculture, livestock grazing, tourism and other developmental activities, poaching for trade and traditional medicine, declining prey populations and conflicts with humans primarily provoked by predation on livestock and crop raiding. Persecution by humans based on real or perceived threats to livestock, death/injuries of human being and crop raiding, appears to be the most important factor in the observed declines in many of the large mammals, and human-large mammal conflict is likely to increase. As a result of livelihood loss, poisoning of cattle killed by large carnivores and retaliatory killing of large herbivores for crop raiding is found to be one of the major threats to large mammal populations. Particularly Protected Areas (PAs) in India are the last refuge for many large mammals however they are sensitive to the effect of habitat degradation outside PAs, being particularly susceptible to species extinction. India’s few existing reserves may not be sufficient enough to maintain viable populations of wide-ranging mammals, although large mammal conservation is mainly dependant on management of surrounding core habitats of PAs, wherein successful conservation resolves human-large mammal conflicts and poaching pressures. The successful human-wildlife management practical action needs park managers and local communities must take coordinated communication to reduce the frequency of conflicts and poaching. For this we seek a digital solution through video based sensor technology for regular monitoring of conflict prone areas. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Crop raiding Human Wildlife Conflict Livelihood Loss Threats to Wildlife Poaching Protected Areas, Video Based Sensor Technology Wildlife Management Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge. Identify and monitor areas prone to conflict and poaching around core habitat of Protected Areas. Improve the efficiency of or even optimize anti-poaching patrols in Protected Areas based on assessments of mortality/conflict patterns. Alerting movement/arrival and exit of conflict prone wild animals to concerned stakeholders Users who are facing the challenge/sub-problem could use data Forest Department, Protected Area Managers, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and local communities living inside and just outside on the fringe areas of Protected Area.

<h4>Digital solution to document, analyse and manage the effect of Tourism on local Biodiversity and Wildlife in Protected Areas and tourist spots.</h4><p>
The Problem: Tourism is a fast-growing industry in our country. Every year more and more people travel and the number of tourists visiting every tourist area is increasing. In the present world marked by a high degree of stress related to urbanization, people are getting attracted more to natural areas such as National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Tiger Reserves and so on. There should be a well-informed preparedness for handling the increasing tourist flow in these Protected Areas (PAs) and natural tourist spots. All type of tourisms such as religious tourism, ecotourism, beach tourism and health tourism will affect immediate environment and biodiversity associated with it in varying degrees. Information on the tourism expansion and its effect should be quantified in real time and the management strategies should be adaptively modified for avoiding negative effect of the tourist movements to the local biodiversity and wildlife. We seek the development of a model digital solution including plan, digital products for information management, analysis and decision support system in a selected tourist area or Protected Area. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Biodiversity, Wildlife, Carrying capacity, Ecotourism, Protected Areas Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge. Assessment of tourist flow, growth and trends . Documentation of wildlife and biodiversity of the area. Analysis of carrying capacity of tourism in the project area. Development of software solution to manage the information flow and return feedback with managerial intervention. Users who are facing the challenge/sub-problem could use data Tourism department and managers of tourism industry. Forest department and managers of protected areas. Travel and Transport managers, managers of resorts and hospitality industry Local communities and other stakeholders including the local administration. Any record keeping databases/ legacy systems or integrations that needs to be considered, Tourist information registry of the location /protected area. Biodiversity and wildlife database of the area in target. Any other natural resource registry in the government offices, water flow of the river and rainfall details of the area. Required channel – mobile app, responsive web, web application, desired. A combination of responsive web and mobile applications for different modules can be attempted. Desired outcome if the challenge is addressed Efficient tourist information management system can be developed. Availability of all necessary information for managers so that informed decisions can be made during critical problems. Better facilities and customer satisfaction for tourists. Details pertaining to the scale of the problem About 500 protected areas in the country and thousands of tourists’ destinations of varying importance can use this. Shelf solutions or legacy solutions partially / fully addresses the challenges. Customized digital solutions for analysing the effect on biodiversity and environment are not available.

<h4>Developing a real-time and automatic early warning system for forest fire</h4><p>
India has over 75 million hectares of forests that cover about 23% of the country’s geographic area. Forests are protected in the country under various laws for their ecosystem services that include their biodiversity wealth, maintenance of soil nutrients, sustenance of freshwater security, provision of livelihood for forest-dwelling communities, and various forest products that are commercially valuable. Forests also serve as the single largest sink for carbon as forest plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and store carbon. For this reason, forests are now considered to be the most potent means to combat global warming. Ironically, the same forests, when they are under fire, pose the gravest threat as they release large volumes of carbon dioxide forest fires are now recognized as the biggest contributor to build-up of atmospheric carbon, leading to global warming and climate change. But early detection of forest fires is a major challenge for forest managers owing to multiple factors like inaccessibility, topography, inclement weather, shortage of frontline staff to man the entire forest tracts, etc. By the time the forest management takes notice of a forest fire, it usually is too late to act and the fire would have spread over hundreds of hectares. Here, we seek a cost-effective, automatic, and real-time remote-surveillance digital solution for early detection of forest fire and prediction of its course based on multiple covariates (like wind speed & direction, rainfall, forest type, proximity to fire-breaks, aspect and slope, etc) that would be measured / calibrated on the ground by employing sensor-based data capture contraptions. Associated Terminology that needs capture or tracking or smart linking Forest fire, carbon stock, weather parameters, forest vegetation, remote-surveillance Sub problems, which need to be resolved, or form key part of the challenge: Forest cover / density estimation Forest type Weather data Seasonality of forest fires Establishing mobile communication network from remote forests to control room Users who are facing the challenge/sub-problem could use data Forest department and forest managers Forest scientists and researchers Forest-dwelling local/tribal communities Any record keeping databases/ legacy systems or integrations that need to be considered Forest Survey of India digital maps of forests of India from 1:25,000 to 1:250,000 scale Survey of India digital toposheets from 1:25,000 to 1:250,000 scale Remote-sensing imageries of forest fires accessed from NRSA to compute seasonality Forest Working Plans / Management Plans for past history of fire Required channel – mobile app, responsive web, web application, desired: Ideally, mobile SMS based alert system may be developed for early detection of forest fire. This can be routed through a central database & command structure. Desired outcome if the challenge is addressed. Early detection of forest fire would save us billions of rupees every year as we would prevent carbon build-up in the atmosphere and subsequent impacts of climate change on food production, human health, and environmental degradation. Though we do not have any assessment made in India, it has been estimated in the US that forest fires cost over 320 million dollars every year. It has also been predicted that the cost of fire would increase exponentially to over 2 billion dollars by the year 2025. The cost is expected to be even more severe in India, with its large tracts of tropical deciduous forests and grasslands that are most vulnerable to forest fire. Details pertaining to the scale of the problem The forest fire is a chronic and major problem in over 75 million hectares of forests of the country (covering about 23% of India’s geographic area). And the carbon stock of Indian forests has been estimated to be around 6500 metric tonnes in 2014 as per FSI report. As a key player of REDD Plus (Reducing Emission through Deforestation and Forest Degradation) protocol, India has a major role in developing forest fire management tools and systems. Shelf solutions or legacy solutions partially / fully addresses the challenges. Current system of fire detection on the ground involves extensive patrolling, which becomes ineffective as we have too few frontline staff to man the entire forests. Even if the forest fire is detected early by the field staff, communication lag is too long to receive any assistance or command from higher authorities before the fire becomes uncontrollable. Though remote-sensing technology is increasingly used in fire management, it does not detect small-scale fire and does not incorporate any efficient customized predictive model.

1. Bandwidth and cost are major determinants for the success of any telemedicine program. 2. Can a telemedicine system be developed which works on low bandwidth and is less costly to provide Tele-consultation services in rural and remote areas of India. Expected outcome: A web/mobile based Tele-consultation system which can work on low bandwidth mobile internet connection for interacting with doctors to provide online care for rural patients.

<h4>Platform for Learning from Disasters</h4><p>
1. These days the country is witnessing various forms of disasters on day to day basis. 2. To mitigate the impact of these disasters- health system also responds by providing curative and preventive care. 3. Since the overall outcome of response to these disasters by health system is not known, it becomes difficult to chalk out strategy to build capacities to further improvement in responses. 4. If all disasters and their impact on health and response of health system is available for analysis-it would help facilitate better management of disasters. Expected Outcome: IT system which helps in documentation of disasters (natural/man-made) occurring within Indian geographies each of these should be plotted on the maps along with the scale of disaster, geographic areas covered and impact. The system should also help in documentation of actions taken by health system to manage these disasters with details covering nature of response, time period of response for each major activity the outcome of these responses total casualties and nature of injuries etc. For each of the disasters the system should be able to identify areas of improvement.</p>

 
<h4>Knowledge Enhancement Platform</h4><p>
1. Several service providers in the field work in relatively isolated settings and don’t have ways to upgrade their skills. 2. Such providers include providers such as medical officers or nurses, or paramedical staff such as laboratory technicians, pharmacists etc. 3. Can digital technology help to create a support group, a space also for learning and sharing, and include interactive training material, with the ability for people to ask questions (like a discussion forum). Expected Outcome: An app-based/web-based IT platform which can enrol all service providers and provide them updated knowledge on various areas- such as clinical knowledge (information about drugs, diseases, new infections, treatment options etc) and administrative knowledge (program guidelines, specific administrative procedures, information about new training materials, forms formats etc). The system should also allow users to share individual clinical case studies, discuss on specific conditions and share ideas.
</p>
 
<h4>SMART System to Guide Patients</h4><p>
1. In large sized hospitals (eg: AIIMS, PGI etc.) when a patient arrives alone or usually along with their care takers in the OPDs , Emergency departments, Pediatrics Centre etc. 2. The patients are generally in emergency condition and often feel lost. The first approach is therefore to the reception bay, from there the patients are directed to go to billing counter, available consultant Doctor is then decided. 3. The whole process, most of the time turns very stressful as it demands critical time of the patient. Sometimes duty guards are not available and available guards are not able to leave their duty areas to guide the patients to their destination in the hospitals. Desired Outcome: A GPRS guided Mobile Tablet fitted permanently on ‘SMART’ Wheel Chairs and in Stretcher bed is a very practical solution to resolve this issue. A pre-loaded software application i.e. the internal maps (similar to google maps) of the hospital need to be developed and installed on such tablets. The Hospital needs to be WiFi enabled and sensors can be attached to the rooms or along the corridors. Now from the start point where the Chairs and stretchers are issued, the starting point and destination point can be filled by trained duty guards. When the care taker of the patient moves with the SMART Wheel Chair or Stretcher, a real-time guided map and a voice (in local / regional or English language) tells the direction till the final destination is arrived. The ‘SMART’ Wheel Chairs and Stretcher beds can be collected by hospital staff later. This system has a potential to save lot of time and dependencies for the patient.</p>

 
<h4>Rationalising Monitoring Visits in the States</h4><p>
1. There are large number of visits being conducted by MoHFW staff to districts for review of the programs and field activities. 2. It would be great if an IT platform helps in analysis of these visits in specific geographies and the areas of action identified for follow-up. 3. This will help in optimum utilization of field visits and also reaching to the districts which are left out from the visits. Desired Outcome: An IT system where every visit by MoHFW staff is documented program-wise and district/state-wise and action items identified for follow-up are also noted. The system should help administrators to identify the districts which were covered/left out and should through follow-up issues that need to be covered in subsequent visit to these districts.</p>

 
<h4>After Death Care</h4><p>
1. Mortuary Vans are largely not available across states and it becomes extremely disappointing if the vans are not available to take dead bodies from hospitals to their respective homes. 2. Though there are vans which are available in private space however there is no single point of contact through which services of these vans could be requested when in need. 3. It is expected that technology can bring all that data in once place and help users and health system to request these services whenever a death is reported in the hospital. The service could be accessed by various means such as miss call, mobile app, sms or call to a central number.
</p>

<h4>Mental Health Services for the Community</h4><p>
1. Mental Health issues carry stigma with them. Most families where a person is suffering from mental illness do not open up about suffering till it is very late. 2. Poor health seeking behaviour along with lack of knowledge about availability of services prevents them from seeking timely care. 3. If the technology platform can provide details when to seek metal health support and where mental health services are available it would be easy for family to visit providers to seek care. Desired Outcome: IT system providing basic tools to assess the need for visiting mental health service provider and listing of the availability of mental health services in the nearby locality to seek care is required.</p>
 
<h4>Improving appointment scheduling in the Hospitals</h4><p>
1. Presently ministry of health and family welfare has started using online appointment system for helping patient get appointments in large tertiary care hospitals like AIIMS. 2. The appointment could be taken for any date and for any provider of choice. However currently there is no mechanism to inform patient if the same provider is not available in the hospital on the scheduled date. 3. The process of rescheduling appointment with any other provider is also not available and for follow-ups the appointment scheduling system does not generate any reminders to the patients and if patient discovers late about the follow-up visit he has to do the entire process of appointment scheduling again to get the appointments done. 4. Digital technology can help to address this issue by identifying mechanism to link the current appointment system with the duty roster of the doctors and also create mechanism for re-appointment of the patients with other providers in case provider of choice is not available. The solution should also include sending follow-up reminders to the patients and helping them to schedule follow-up visits with the doctors without registering for the appointment once again. Desired Outcome: i) This helps in building more trust among patients about the hospital and would also encourage patients to get timely follow-up visits done to improve their health status. ii) Any technology such as web, App or some SMS based system could be used to fulfill this need.</p>

At present, most of the doctors during their practice write brand drugs, which are available in only in specific medical stores and these medicines can’t be purchased from any other place because they are not sold uniformly across all places. 2. When a patient suffering from chronic condition travels from one place to another and forgets to carry his/her medicine, it becomes difficult to get same medicine in other place. 3. The lack of information about similar combination brand drug availability locally affects the adherence to the treatment for these patients. 4. Technology can help to address this issue partially by helping to identify a similar brand medicine combinations sold in various geographies- meaning one brand medicine sold in a district/state and its equivalent brand medicine in other district/states. In case the similar combination brand drug is not available in desired district- it should also help to identify the nearby places from where this medicine can be purchased by the patient. 5. In addition to help identify supplied medicine is not a counterfeit. Desired Outcome: i) A transparent system of identifying brand drugs and details of their sales in geographies (state/districts). Along with the mapping of similar combination brand drugs with each other which can be used to query presence of a brand medicine in a jurisdiction in case other one is not available. ii) This could be made available in both web and App format. This can potentially help patients adhere with the treatment in case they fail to carry their medicines.</p>

<h4>Matching the specialist knowledge with requirements</h4><p>
Today every work is getting more and more specialized and there are specialists who can do the job much more efficiently and fast. For example today I have a requirement of translating (subtitle) 100 hours of educational videos into four languages, within two weeks. This is a work that can be done in our country without much difficulty. But I do not know who are people who can do that. In today’s fast world where things are to be done yesterday, the number of such requirements across the country would be immense. Here again the issue is of matching of the work requirement with the people who can do the work. In many cases working from remote would be possible. As Government would be one of the major work generator the system should be usable by the Government.</p>

<h4>Smart Drip Irrigation System</h4><p>
Drip irrigation, also known as trickle irrigation or micro irrigation or localized irrigation, is an irrigation method that allows water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, through a network of valves, pipes or emitter. Drip Irrigation prevents soil erosion, saves water and can also supply fertilizers to crops. The most significant advantage of this technique is that it allows water conservation as water is supplied in a targeted manner near the root zone of plants in a drip by drip fashion. Objective To Design of a reliable, robust and intelligent drip irrigation controller device for regions devoid of reliable weather prediction and water supply. This device is intended to help farmers make more efficient use of precious water while avoiding dehydration of crops. Expected Outcomes 1. The designed device should be able to determine: Root structure and watering needs of the crop Soil type and moisture level of the soil Water level in a water tank Temperature, humidity, insolation and barometric pressure of the environment, etc. 2. Based on observed environmental factors such as expectation of rain, dampness of the soil, water in reserves etc., schedule a drip irrigation strategy for a certain length of time in future which supervises: When to irrigate or not irrigate a field The drip rates during the intervals when irrigation is enabled Fertilizer supply rates during irrigation, etc. 3. Clearly identify the different tasks and their interdependencies and design an end-to-end functional model. 4. Determine the different hardware components to be used (such as micro-controllers, sensors, relays, modems, LCDs etc.) clearly justifying their need. Finally, obtain an end-to-end architectural model of the system. 5. Clearly describe how the intended function model designed in step 3 should be realized through the architectural model designed in step 4.

<h4>Intelligent low cost Insulin Pump</h4><p>
Diabetes is a major public health problem that is approaching epidemic proportions globally and especially in India. According to the International Diabetes Federation, there are now an estimated 65 million adults with diabetes in India. That number is projected to increase to 109 million by 2035. There are basically three types of Diabetics namely, Type-1, Type-2 and Gestational. While Type-2 diabetics can be generally treated with drugs, for the other two cases, insulin is mandatory. The most challenging is the treatment of Type-1 diabetes, primarily because of the age of the target population being children. To elaborate, as insulin is to be injected subcutaneously multiple times in a day (i.e., Bolus before meals and Basal for the entire background of day-night) by self, children generally skip the injections. Gestational Diabetics affect pregnant women, but as the dose of insulin generally is high multiple injections per day makes the process painful. Insulin Pumps also known as Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) therapy has come as a boon for type1 and gestational diabetic patients. The pump is a small battery operated device worn outside the body. It continuously delivers insulin through a very thin tube inserted under the skin. The tube needs to be replaced once in 3-4 days thereby greatly reducing the number of injections. The pump uses fast acting insulin to give a basal (background) rate which is pre-programmed and delivered in small pulses every hour. In addition, a bolus dose of insulin is delivered by pressing buttons on the pump to cover carbohydrate in the food eaten or give a correction if the blood glucose is high. However, the main challenge associated with a pump is the full manual intervention to program the pump based on the patient requirement. While the basal rate can be more or less fixed, however the bolus requirements are quite dynamic and depend on the carbohydrate intake. Thus, effective use of the pump requires extensive knowledge which mainly involves medical professionals. However, the Bolus doses are difficult to be pre-programmed because of the difference in time of meals and amount of carbohydrate intake. Also, insulin doses depend on several other factors which are not taken into account namely, exercise, illness, stress etc. In this hardware Hackathon project, we aim at the design and development of robust, usable and cost-effective insulin pumps with the following salient features: 1. Periodic integrated blood sampling (minimal invasiveness) and testing mechanism carried out by wearable digital micro-fluidic biochips. 2. Automated acquisition of the obtained test reports from biochips, removal of noise and detection of invariants (normal and abnormal events). 3. An efficient feedback based stochastic insulin injection scheduling and pump control mechanism that will not only generate a schedule for the injections but also optimize the insulin dose such that the body’s insulin level is always maintained within a desired comfort band. The algorithms need to be low overhead to take decisions at short time granularities in response to almost instantaneous insulin level changes and disturbances. At the same time they must perform computationally intensive stochastic information processing to account for variations like food intake, exercise, illness, stress etc. while still being reasonably accurate.</p>

 
<h4>Designing a voice based surveillance system for detecting Phishing attacks that fraudulently obtains the bank account details of unsuspecting customers through phone calls</h4><p>
In recent years, many bank customers have been victims of the Phishing scams, wherein the attacker posing as a bank official convinces the unsuspecting customers to divulge their bank account credentials like, ATM password, online banking user ID / password details, OTP passwords etc. The aim of this Hackathon project is to develop a voice based system for detecting such attacks. The system is to be an add-on to the existing hardware of a smart-phones that keeps track of certain voice keywords like, PIN code, ATM card, Netbanking, UserID, lucky draw winner etc., in the conversation occurring between the potential attacker and the victim. When these keywords are detected, the system switches to the surveillance mode and starts tracking various details about the potential attacker like, the origin/location of the attacker’s call, phone no., service provider details etc., and stores them in a temporary memory. If there are any transactions in the customer’s bank account within a predefined threshold time (user configurable to the hardware) after the conversation has ended, then the system sends an alert message to both the customer and bank about the transactions. The alert message comprises various details regarding the bank transaction like, IP address of the machine from where the transaction was carried out, transaction ID, time stamp of transaction, phone numbers details (service provider names, phone user names and geographic location) of both the user and the potential attacker.</p>

         <h4> Public address system</h4><p>
It is observed that the announcements from public address systems at railway satations are at times not audible. It may be due to train noise, crowding at the station, technical defects in the public address system etc. A solution needs to be evolved so that the passengers can listen to such announcements clearly on their personal devices like mobile etc.</p>

 
<h4>Machine reading of content of customer feed back</h4><p>
Indian Railways has online system of customer feedback in suggestion. Customers can give their feedback on website, mobile application as well as through social media. Since the number of feedback is large, machine reading of the content and classification among various departments, zonal and regional offices can help in quick transfer of such feedback to the concerned officials for immediate redressal. A solution need to be developed for such a utility.</p>

 
<h4>Involving Passengers in Upkeep of Railway Stations</h4><p>
Railway stations are used by two categories of passengers – daily commuters and occasional travelers. Involving passengers in station upkeep through education and active participation can help in finding a lasting solution. Software to keep people engaged about the need to maintain the railway stations is required.</p>

 
<h4>Management of Railway Rest Houses & Holiday Homes</h4><p>
At present, the allocation of accommodation in Railway Rest Houses, Holidays Homes is done manually. The request is to be given in writing and there is no mechanism to advise the applicant about status of booking of rooms. This causes uncertainty and difficulty in planning one’s programme. An online system of submitting request and allocation of rooms is required.</p>

 
<h4>Passenger Security</h4><p>
Security of passengers and their belongings is of paramount importance for Indian Railways. In case of any untoward incident or incident of crime against passengers and their belongings matter can be reported to Government Railway Police at Railway stations and on trains and also through given security helpline telephone number 182.

        <h4>Monitoring of electricity at household level</h4><p>
• The Government is planning to deliver 24*7 electricity to all the consumers from 2019. In this regards developments in Generation, Transmission and Distribution needs to be monitored for effective implementation. • At present, no monitoring of electricity at household level is done. Feeder level monitoring has just started and AT&C losses are captured at Feeder level. • Analysing the Electricity availability in real time at household/ individual level can aid in bringing transparency and accountability and help analyse reliability parameters such as SAIDI and SAIFI. Users of the System: • The data needs to be collected from anyone and everyone possible so as to remove the problems of biases and sampling error. This means that the solution must cater to both digitally empowered citizens and also to people without internet. • The users can be anyone from the citizens to the discoms who can access the data for monitoring field level realities. It can also be used by policy makers and even small scale businessmen who will want to know about the power situation in an area over time before setting up businesses. Solution Required • A lightweight app with a very simple and intuitive UI/UX with a dedicated button to report absence of power. The app must have access to the location and the device ID among other requirements to uniquely identify the consumer. • Any other mechanism for people with no internet access or without any smartphone to access this reporting system. ( missed call for example) Work till Now. Back End The following functionalities must be present 1) Data collation: Discom wise and State Wise 2) Messaging: 1 hr 4 hrs 12 and 24( issue escalation to various authorities as per seniority. For example, if no Power for more than 1 but less than 4 hrs then an automatic message can be sent to the concerned JE. This message details can be logged to pull up the people at fault) 3) Electricity Map: Country wide ( A GIS map which can be accessed by authorities and once it stabilises can be made public. This map will show historical availability of electricity in every state by using colour coding etc) 4) Feeder level: Variation if any 5) Flash Reasons: If any ( the app should be able to communicate and let users know about the reason for the power cut, if necessary) 6) Power Users ( Trusted Users, using algorithm to match and verify their response with users in the neighbourhood/ same DT/ same Feeder. The app can have customer ID and AADHAR integrated with it) 7) Auto Detection of Location and Asset Mapping on GIS The Eventual aim is to build a repository of data on the presence/ absence of electricity across the country at a granular level( household) in real time. The data must be presented in an easily understandable manner.</p>


<h4>Efficient, Easy and Integrated Billing System</h4><p>
• One of the main reasons for inefficiency in DISCOMs today is regular meter reading, bill generation and bill collection. This is one of the major contributor to AT&C losses facing the DISCOMs. • At present different Discoms (as of now there are 92 distribution companies in India) follow different process of bill collection. It involves there sub steps: Metering and meter reading Bill Generation Bill Collection • At present because of the inefficiency in the process there is huge revenue loss to the Discoms. • Today there is no mechanism that integrates all these and provides easy, hassle free and efficient way of bill collection. Users of the System: • Utilities/Discoms who are distributing electricity are the billers • The consumers of the electricity – domestic, industrial and commercial are the bill payers in the system. As we can see that it all encompassing and covers the entire populace and citizenry of the country. • It is also pertinent to note that domestic consumers are from varied regions and sections of the society. That include people from rural and remote areas of the nation who have difficulty in access to internet. So the solution should be able to cover them also. Desired Outcome: • An efficient and integrated meter reading, bill generation and bill payment mechanism that can provide end to end solution. • At one hand it should reduce to hassle and increase the comfort for the bill payers and on the other hand it should increase the revenue collection for the Discoms and reduce the cost of collection. Hence a win – win solution for all.</p>

 
<h4>Non-availability of the literature related to Geological surprises encountered in completed hydropower projects</h4><p>
Geological and Geo-technical plays an important role in hydropower sector. The survey and investigation plays the critical role for successful completion of the hydropower projects. Even with adequate survey and investigation during construction of the hydropower projects, geological surprises are often encountered which leads to delay in the commission of the project and hence resulted into cost overrun. In India and abroad number of hydropower projects has been commissioned and running successfully, out of many project have faced geological surprises. At present there is no such source country wise where the geological and geotechnical problems encountered by the projects have been placed in a digital place. If these literature is put in a common place in a digital media then the knowledge and experiences gained can be implemented to future projects, so that the project can be commissioned in scheduled time without any cost overrun. The user of this System • The person who will maintain and update the library time to time. • The geologist who will access this library and apply the knowledge to the upcoming hydropower projects. Technology that can address these issues. • An open access online library to access this literature from anywhere and anytime. Desire outcome. • Geologist can gain knowledge of different geological challenges faced in hydropower projects • Knowledge can be applied to the future upcoming projects • It will decrease the time and cost overruns of the projects • Country will be benefited.

<h4>Integrated Automatic Floor Warning and Alert System using IoT</h4><p>
1. There have been a few unfortunate incidents in the recent past where tourists/locals in the catchment area of a river were caught unware of an impending flash flood/release of water from dams of Hydro Projects upstream. This led to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of valuable human lives. 2. Presently, individual Hydra Projects are spreading awareness about impending release of water in the catchment area to locals in that specific area through SMS. 3. District administration has cordoned off access to the river catchment and Public Announcement vans are deployed in the local area before release of water from dams. 4. Announcement and early warning needs to be automated and without manual intervention to make it more effective. 5. This shall also make the hydro-sector more people friendly and caring for local lives and resources and shall increase acceptability of the future hydro projects simultaneously improve perception of Hydro sector. Possible approach to solve the problem: 1. There could be a central database connecting all hydro power stations (HPS) in the country, where information before release of water from dams of all projects would be consolidated. The HPS would need to enter data about release of water well in advance to this central database/repository. 2. Telecom solutions may be developed to send warning SMS to all mobile phone users in the area/river basin of HPS which going to release water and downstream in the river basis, based on real time information collected from telecom operators as to the number of users being served by mobile towers located in the area. 3. The warning SMS should be sent to all users identified above, overriding the DND registries. 4. All-weather Public-Announcement systems may be used/developed based on Internet of Things (IoT) and placed above electricity poles/other such infrastructure near the river basin. They may be connected through OPGW (optical fibre composite overhead ground wire) cables wherever available or may work on wireless systems to be more efficient. 5. The PA systems should be connected with the central database and start warning announcements automatically without manual intervention. 6. Any other novel approach to solve the problem is also welcome. Possible scalability and uses ink the future: 1. An IoT for all buoys measuring river measuring river discharge data may be created and linked together. On sudden increase in water discharge in any of the buoys, warning signals may be relayed to all PA systems downstream to prevent loss of life and infrastructure during flash floods /cloudbursts. Such information could also be gathered through satellite/space technology. 2. This system may also be expanded to irrigation projects and flood warning of all kinds. 3. The system must be scalable for use with advanced space technology and satellite data along with physical scalability of deploying increasing number of buoys and PA systems. 4. The IoT of buoys may also be used to collect all sorts of hydrological/ discharge data for recording and forecasting.

Development of Entrepreneurship Facilitation – Guidance Centre Platform</p>

 
<h4>Helping youth make informed decisions on career choices in the vocational sector</h4><p>
With 1 million youth entering the job market every month, vocational pathways as an alternative to academic stream is imperative. While several thousand skill canters have opening across the county. Informed decision making on which trade a candidate undertakes training is lacking. This is because there is information asymmetry. If youth had access to relevant information (online) – they can make an informed decision on choice of trade and opt for appropriate training. Information such as 1) Options available (sectors and job roles) 2) Access where such training is available 3) Cost – free or paid 4) Academic requirements 5) Job prospects 6) Estimated wages 7) Career progression etch would greatly assist in making appropriate choices. There could also be provision of psychometric tests which could provide suggestions on trades which would be most suitable. This would be empowering for candidates and potentially improve outcome metrics as also reduce dropout rates which are currently high.</p>
 
<h4>Migration Trends:</h4><p>
By using publicly available data through IMO and MEA, we can see the migration trends and forecast our requirements based on the same. This would include international and national migration trends (Natural Calamity or any Disaster). If some indicators are included like preferred location to migrate, reasons to migrate, stands of living- before migrating and post migration, etc. We can get granular information regarding the trend. This will be very useful for IISC, in planning future programs.</p>

 
<h4>BIOG DATA Problem Statement</h4><p>
Mapping of Typical Zones (List below) in India through publically available data and directly linking them to our skill development courses. Example 7.1 Through publicly available data, we can map the crime rate/unemployment rate and the type of crime rate in different regions of India. Let’s say a district in UP ‘Saharanpur’’ has the highest rate of crime in Uttar Pradesh, we should focus more over there through our skill development initiatives Or Chandigarh Reports highest number of ATM theft cases, our security sector skill council can upskill security guards or train more of them particularly for Chandigarh. 7.2 Mapping MNREGA scheme and look alike schemes & linking it through PMKVY or different initiatives. 7.3 SMART/Skilled Region (either a district or a panchayat): if we can get information regarding the skill capacity of the person in that region (district/panchayat), we can categorize that region into a SMART/Skilled region. (it’s mapping a region with skills of persons).</p>

 
<h4>From a potential employer’s view:</h4><p>
Creating a platform which can crawl information over the internet through websites where Tenders and Proposals are being listed out in India. Through AlI, the system can track the force requirement in each proposal and can submit an entry on the website. Additionally, we can take future requirements from the corporate for their upcoming projects and allocate PMKVY numbers based on their commitment. The system can record the future demand of the corporates and through the dashboard can know the details where his workforce is getting trained.
 </p>
<h4>System to track Labor market trends</h4><p>
Sector : Health & Social WelfareCategory : softwarePriority : high#MSD15
To know skilling needs (distributed through geographies and sectors) through Big Data analytics –on a continuous ongoing basis. Integrating skill/competence based indicators and outputs/outcomes based indicators with the available data base will enable pooling of data from other sources, like Census/NSSO/Labour Bureau etc.</p>
 
<h4>Development of Compliance Platform</h4><p>
This e – application will provide back office support to entrepreneurs for any and all compliance requirements, capacity building. As of today Govt has taken several initiatives in minimizing, simplifying, consolidating number of compliance requirements and at the same time conducting capacity building workshops like for GST rollout. Today for their compliance requirements entrepreneur has to access open market for professional consultancy, back office support. Through this intervention Govt will have e-platform accessible in both Online and Offline mode through existing Govt infrastructure like CSC/DIC and will provide end to end compliance solutions at a socially priced rate card.</p>
 
<h4>Development of Convergence of International – Central – State Start Up Platform</h4><p>
Hon’ble Prime Minister has taken a pioneering set up by having Joint Start Up Platforms like India – Portugal, Israel. This e-platform will provide under one micro website all Start Up viz Central and State Govt, Partner Start Up Initiatives with Countries abroad and International Start Up ecosystem so that entrepreneurs can replicate start up success stores by customizing the products/ services to India specific environment. This will provide huge impetus to employment as under Start Up Policy unveiled on 16.01.2015, entrepreneurs will be able to bring innovative products and services adapted to Indian context and remediate various social sector, infrastructure and other B2B, B2C businesses.
</p>
 
<h4>Development of Business Accelerator Platform</h4><p>
Taking cue from the Start Up Portugal, there is a dedicated robust Business Accelerator system. Through this e-application entrepreneurs can access Business Accelerator services today spread across the country in a decoupled manner, resulting in lack of access to business support services, co-working entrepreneurial ecosystem as business accelerators are set up in a fragmented manner, lack of Information access to Products/ Funding, facilities available under a particular business accelerator. There will also be provision for developing Certified Business Accelerator Professionals.
</p>
 
<h4>Development of Business Incubator Platform</h4><p>
Taking cue from the Start Up Portugal, there is a dedicated robust Business Incubator system. Through this e-application entrepreneurs can access Business Incubator services today spread across the country in a decoupled manner, resulting in lack of access to business support services, co-working entrepreneurial ecosystem as business incubators are set up in a fragmented manner, lack of Information access to Products/ Funding, facilities available under a particular business incubator.

<h4>Development of Logistics Platform</h4><p>
Sector : Health & Social WelfareCategory : softwarePriority : high#MSD10
One of the key issues faced by both existing and potential entrepreneurs is Access to Single Window – Centralized Logistics Solutions providing Economies viz Air, Road, Water, Multimodal, and Space. Today a Micro Entrepreneur, Cluster, SHG, Social Enterprise and even small and medium enterprises face a significant gap in “How to Sell Direct to end Customers viz B2C , B2B , Exports , Import of Machinery, Raw Materials, Goods for Trading.</p>

 
<h4>Development of E-Marketing – Procurement Platform</h4><p>
One of the Key Issues – Challenges faced by both existing and potential entrepreneurs and also one of the key disablers for entrepreneurship ‘picking up’ as a self employment career option is “Uncertainty of Marketing of Products/Services”. Though there is lot of schemes from the Central Government for e.g. NSIC, Procurement Policy but there either No Awareness or Filling Up Forms, Applying under the said schemes is a big hurdle faced by the entrepreneurs and resultant inspite of Policy been there, entrepreneurs are not able to “Sell their Products / Services”. This leads to working capital issues, cash flows uncertainty vis a vis fixed income employment. In view of aforestated issues in brief, there is requirement for an E-Marketing Platform that can interlink with Central Public Sector Undertakings covered under Procurement Policy, GEM, Relief Supplies made to National – State Disaster Relief Authority for rescue, relief and rehabilitation operations, interlink with United Nation procurement, International Missions – NGO’s – Charities like US Aid for procurement of supplies / consumables from this e-marketing platform.</p>

 
<h4>Development of Social Entrepreneurship Platform</h4><p>
In view of various Initiatives taken by the Hon’ble Prime Minister like Swatch Bharat, Make In India, Promotion of Organic Farming, Common Service Centers, Companies Act – CSR Guidelines, CSIR Rural Technologies, Green Business, Solar Alliance, National Innovation Foundation, Exemption for Section 8 Companies etc- there is a surge in entrepreneurial interest in social start ups addressing development needs and at the same time promoting employment generation, livelihood and social profits for the entrepreneur. Presently there is “None” platform that caters exclusively to the Social Sector. This Social Entrepreneurship Platform accessible in Online and Offline mode , vernacular will list all CSIR , NIF Ideas, Opportunities – – Projects – RFP floated by Govt or Not for Profit or Private Sector. This platform will list all CSR Opportunities available at State , Central, Regional and International level, E – forms for applying for CSR Funds – that can be filled both Online and Offline mode, Rating of CSR Funded Projects both Grantor and Grantee evaluation, Provision for Impact Assessment both Qualitative and Monetary, Linking to Rewards and Recognition, Awards in the Development sector domain. There will be listing of Social Sector Policy Interventions, Budget Incentives.</p>

 
<h4>Development of Online Mentor Platform</h4><p>
For Starting Up, Scaling Up, Diversifying, Expanding any Existing and or Potential Enterprise a robust Mentor platform is required. Mentors and Mentee can register on this platform. Technology tools like Skype, Go To Meeting, Team viewer, Smart Phone, Mentoring booths set up at Common Service Centers, DIC, Incubator, Accelerator, PM Yuva Centers, e – learning studio at NSIC ( aforesaid may require signing of inter departmental – Institutional – ministerial MOU ‘s – provision of digital filling up and signing of MOUs), Atal Innovation Mission – Tinkering labs etc will be leveraged For mentor registration there will be a provision of First Assessment – viz experience in entrepreneurship education, guidance, technical – professional – skills, aptitude, time – days, duration when available, mode of availability viz online or offline mode or a blend of both. There will be a provision of Mentor tutorials, Non disclosure agreement, and Ethics statement. There will be Mentor Evaluation – Grading and Recognition, Badge – Star Rating viz benchmarks aligned to ILO SIYB Trainers – viz Increase in Revenues, Turnover, Productivity Gains, Start Up Registration, Start Up Registration for 6 Months, Profits, Business Process efficiency, Access to funds, Access to Resources viz Material, Machine, Equipment, Business Premises, Factory, Co-working space. International best practices in development of Mentor platform accessible in both Offline and Online mode adapted and customized to local requirements.</p>

 
<h4>Skill India App</h4><p>
This will be a mammoth task to perform but if we are able to do it, we would be able to work effectively .Integrating everything into one single app i.e. Skill India App. It should include all the details like 1. Enroll yourself for PMKVY 2. Become an NSDC training partner 3. Partner with Skill India 4. Contribute your CSR Funds to Skill India Mission 5. Participate in World Skills Competition 6. Find a training Center Nearby 7. Setup a call or attend our weekly webinar 8. Tenders or RFPs 9. Skill GAP Study 10. Report issues regarding a training institute Etc. If we can integrate and create a product which becomes our ‘ONE STOP SOLUTION’, it would be an effective way of dissemination knowledge.</p>

         <h4>GPS based technique for improving Land Use Survey in ICS Scheme (LAKSHYA)</h4><p>
Problem Statement: At present the Land Use Survey is conducted manually in the field and is thus likely to be inadequate. Problem Redefined: 1. Can the land use be reliably estimated as complete? 2. Can the land use be mapped with the land holdings in field? Technology that can address this issue: The LAKSHYA can improve upon the exact positioning of holding centre and crop plots can be combined with other geo referenced thematic information. It can also prepare digital base maps for spatial analyses and planning. Desired Outcomes: 1. Ensuring Completeness of the land use 2. Ensuring reduction in underestimation of crop estimation 3. Wider acceptability of the survey</p>

 
<h4>Digitization of Aerial frame using mobile application (DIGIFRAME)</h4><p>
Problem Statement: 1.It is customary to make special efforts to build up a sampling frame to meet the specific requirements. Field Operations Division (FOD) of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) does similar exercise through Urban Frame Survey to prepare the frame for Socio- Economic surveys. 2.A household approach is adopted for collecting data through most socio-economic inquiries. Since the frame for ultimate sampling units (households) is neither available nor feasible to be prepared afresh every time on account of time and cost factors, the sampling methods are so designed as to select the households in successive stages. For the rural areas, list of census villages comes in handy as an operationally convenient and readily accessible frame of first stage units. In the urban sector, however, the population census does not provide an analogous list of geographical units that could be conveniently adopted as a sampling frame. The UFS was conceived and formulated to obviate this particular situation. 3. At present the maps are manually prepared and are mostly used in-house by the NSSO whereas the demand for such aerial surveys is increasingly significant. Problem Redefined: 1. Can the aerial frame be more exhaustive and specific (Completeness)? 2. Can the aerial frame encompass more relevant details about urban locality? 3. Can its usage be made universally acceptable? Technology that can address this issue: The DIGIFRAME, would ensure inter alia Completeness of the frame ensured (with the complete area coverage of town), which may help in reducing underestimation of population. Further, it shall enhance the utility of UFS, as various organizations may find the digitized UFS data useful for conducting their surveys. The process of the DIGIFRAME would significantly cut down the time and resources. After completion of phase, uniform digitized UFS data would be available throughout the country. Digitized UFS maps, if completed in time, may be useful for RGI in next Census. Desired Outcomes: 1. Ensuring Completeness of the frame 2. Ensuring reduction in underestimation of urban population 3. Wider acceptability of the survey frame
 </p>
<h4>Rural Price Collection through APP ( RUPICOM)</h4><p>
Problem Statement: At present the RPC schedules are canvassed by the field offices wherein field functionaries’ visits far flung rural markets, pan India. Further, the response of the shopkeepers during the peak hour is not very encouraging. The system will have an inbuilt consistency checks for ensuring apposite entry in the relevant columns and in line with the entries of the item during last month. This will save time and resources of the field offices and the release of the quarterly price bulletin can be advanced. Problem Redefined: 1. Can the items listed in the schedule automatically generate its quoted price during the previous month? 2. Can the state code/market code and the item codes automatically appears in the schedule since they all remain unchanged? 3. Can the GPS coordinates be captured automatically through the system? Technology that can address this issue: The RUPICOM, a mobile based app, can address this issue quite effectively. The app will include the list of all items from the basket as also its state code, market code and the price that was quoted by the shopkeeper during last month. Desired Outcomes: 1. Reduction in timelines 2. Improved response rate of the Shopkeepers 3. Saving on the resources of the filed offices
</p>
 
<h4>Automated Compilation of ASI Schedules (AUDYOGIC)</h4><p>
Problem Statement: The Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) is the principal source of industrial statistics in India. It provides statistical information to assess and evaluate, objectively and realistically, the changes in the growth, composition and structure of organised manufacturing sector comprising activities related to manufacturing processes, repair services, gas and water supply and cold storage. The duly filled in returns for the Central Sample are compiled by the field offices and transmitted online to CSO (IS Wing) through ASI Web Portal for processing and publication of results. At present there is considerable time gap by when the filled-in-schedules are received and by when they are processed. Further, compliance of the statutory returns (schedules) may not be cent-percent. Problem Redefined: 1. Can the ASI schedules be submitted by the Entrepreneurs themselves? 2. Can the relevant entries of ASI schedule are mapped through the Balance Sheet, P/L Account and the Attendance Register of a Company? 3. Can the relevant entries in ASI schedule be transmitted automatically through the mapped cells of the Balance Sheet, P/L Account and the Attendance Register? 4. Can a simple report through the MIS be generated? 5. Can an appropriate notification be issued indicating the completion of the ASI schedule to the concerned field offices as also the Entrepreneurs? Technology that can address this issue: The AUDYOGIC App can significantly cut in time by when the Establishments can comply with the requirements of the ASI Return. The system will have an inbuilt consistency checks for ensuring apposite entry in the relevant columns and in line with the entries of the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Account and muster roll, attendance register etc. The proposed app will have a one to one mapping of various columns with the P/L Account, Balance Sheet, and Attendance Register etc. Desired Outcomes: 1. Reduction in timelines 2. Improved response rate by the Entrepreneurs 3. Improved compliance of the statute</p>


<h4>Estimation of trade Margins</h4><p>
Problem statement: Send sms using bulk sms facility to identified establishments from the GSTN frame based on the mobile numbers available from the REG 1 to get Trade margins in a standard format of the top five products. The sms should have: 1. GSTN HSNcode sales purchase prices 2. Total turnover of the company Technical specifications (definition): Trade margin is the difference between the sale value of good purchased for resale (either wholesale or retail) and the value of the purchase of such goods. Technology that can address this issue: Trademarginapp 1. The app should enable to tabulate the responses received by return sms in a dedicated number or by email by HSN codes 2. The sms to be sent would comprise of the format and the definition. The receipt would be in the form of a maximum of six lines.</p>

 
<h4>Online data dissemination and dynamic costing through web portal</h4><p>
Computer Centre of the Ministry is responsible for storage and dissemination of survey and macroeconomic data of CSO and National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) like National Accounts, IIP, NSS, Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and Economic Census (EC). Currently this data is being disseminated in PDF, EXCEL, CSV files and costing is done using a static formula. It is proposed to disseminate the data using a dynamic algorithm using volume, complexity and other such parameters for arriving at an optimal cost. The data will then be disseminated online through convenient channels like shared storage space, email etc. This will not only reduce the carbon footprint but conveniently satisfy the end users requirement.</p>

 
<h4>Engagement Management System (EMS) through an Application for Desktop as well as Mobile-phones.</h4><p>
Problem Statement: The engagements of Hon’ble Minister, Chairman, National Statistical Commission (NSC), Secretary, M/o Statistics &Programme Implementation and other senior officers of the Ministry are required to be shared with each other from time to time, especially while scheduling a meeting/seminar/workshop etc. This becomes important to know the availability of the senior officers to ensure their presence in the meeting/seminar/workshop etc. At present, the engagements are handled in individual platform only by the staff of the senior officers. To address this issue this is a need of an application which can have multiple users and can be shared with each other. Sample data required: No Problem Redefined: 1. Can the app be accessed on desktop and mobile phone/both android as well as window based? 2. Can reports of engagements be generated for one officer or multiple officers at a time? 3. Can multiple engagements be entered in a particular time slot for one officer? Is so, then it may be ranked on importance of priority of officer. 4. For viewing the engagements, can the same be seen for a particular month, group of months and also for year, as per requirement? 5. In case of any addition/ alteration, can notifications be popped up through SMS? Technology that can address this issue: An online app which can be accessed on desktop and mobile phone/both android as well as windows based. Desired Outcomes: 1. Proper management of schedules/timings 2. Engagement can be shared to Multiple users 3. E-Updation/E-alteration/E-cancellation of the meeting 4. Automatic confirmation for the meeting 5. Report generation for engagements 6. Print options for specific reports</p>

 
<h4>Sub-national PPP data collection through mobile based application software</h4><p>
Problem Statement: On the line of International Comparison Program (ICP), a global statistical initiative which compiles PPP at county level, the sub-national PPP Program for India which has been devised to compile the PPP for the India at various regional levels within the country. Data collection for common/ similar of items with common specifications across the regions has been defined. The data collection of sub national PPP may be carried with the help of a mobile based application software which will not only save resources but also provide a reliable and robust digital platform starting from day one. Problems Redefined: i. Can the detailed item-wise specifications be mapped with various markets (poor, middle & rich) at various locations of the country? ii. Can it be possible to note the GPS location, time and date of data collection with the name of the market? Technology that can address this issue: The SNPPPAPP, a mobile based application software for Sub-national PPP data collection can address the issue. The application may integrate the common /similar item with respective specifications of specified selected markets across various regions of the country The GPS enabled application would also have the features of displaying the time of visit to the market along with latitude and longitude information and which in turn would have to extract the market location from the Goggle map to ensure the location mapping between the actual GPS location and the market & shop visited by the field staff. Desired Outcomes: 1. Real time price data collection. 2. Improvements in quality of data validation and scrutiny. 3. Ensuring physical presence of the data collectors in the market.

         <h4>Proper linkage / mechanism to spot tribal youth talent in sports and nurture them</h4><p>
Tribal youths are talented in many sports, but proper linkage / mechanism to spot such talent and nurture them are missing. An app could be developed to bridge this gap. Any tribal youth interested in sports may upload basic details like sports specialisation/ interest area, gender, age, district, state which will enable them to locate the opportunities available for which he/she is eligible for. The Sports Authorities could also reach out to these individuals for providing them advanced training or any other support.</p>

 
<h4>App / portal / wiki-page required to document rich tribal heritage and culture</h4><p>
There is rich tribal heritage and culture including language, dialect, cuisine, flora & fauna, religious practices related to child birth, pregnancy, marriage, death, festivals etc., dance, music, art & craft, folklores etc. Young people could be encouraged to document this through an attractively designed mobile App. This could be linked to the Tribal Heritage Repository being developed by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (http://tribal.nic.in/repository)</p>

 
<h4>Small videos by highly qualified doctors, prepared or dubbed in local tribal languages, could be part of an App with proper animations required for trials for the awareness of common diseases to life</h4><p>
8. Availability of health care providers in tribal areas is a big challenge and the tribals have to rely on local quacks or traditional healers for anything ranging from common diseases to life threatening diseases. Small videos by highly qualified doctors, prepared or dubbed in local tribal languages, could be part of an App with proper animations etc.</p>

 
<h4>Solution to combine data related to STs from multiple sources and present it in an easy-to-use format</h4><p>
7. Statistical analysis of ST data is highly needed and is a pre-requisite for any policy decision and plan formulation for the welfare of STs. Data on STs are available in multiple sources like Census, MIS of various schemes of line Ministries, and statistical reports etc. An integrated web-based application could be developed to combine data related to STs from multiple sources and present it in an easy-to-use format.</p>

 
<h4>An App required to provide relevant information to STs about available laws protecting them from atrocities and subjugation</h4><p>
6. Knowledge about available laws protecting ST from atrocities is very low – App could be developed to provide relevant information to STs so that they can take help from the available laws protecting them from atrocities and subjugation. This App would also help in simplifying or decoding legal language of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 through a user-friendly interactive interface. Other relevant laws could also be added.</p>

 
<h4>Solution required to help especially ST parents locate the tribal schools, hostels (availability, vacant seats), information about the admission procedure, eligibility etc. based on their choice of lo</h4><p>
5. MoTA promotes tribal education through multiple interventions viz. Ekalavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs), ashram schools and hostels for boys and girls across India. There are many ST parents who have little idea about the location of these school and hostels, number of seats available, eligibility criteria etc. and hence not clear about where to get their children enrolled. An app could be developed to help such parents locate the tribal schools, hostels (availability, vacant seats), information about the admission procedure, eligibility etc. based on their choice of location.</p>

 
<h4>Solution required to promote tourism in Tribal areas by tribal people</h4><p>
Minuscule use of eco-tourism potential of tribals and in tribal areas – An app may be developed to promote tourism in Tribal areas by tribal people. Any tribal can use this to promote their locality, business venture in tribal areas/ village. Local homestays, tribal tours, cultural performances could be promoted. Unexplored Bastar (www.unexploredbastar.com), Slum Gods of Dharavi (www.slumgods.in), etc. are some examples.</p>
 
<h4>Solution required to increase awareness about other schemes among FRA (Forest Rights Act) title holders</h4><p>
3. Low awareness about other schemes among FRA title holders- The right holders under FRA are also entitled to benefits under various other schemes and programmes of the Government. However owing to low awareness many right holders have not been able to avail these benefits. An app could be developed to quickly identify and inform the FRA right holders about all such schemes/programmes whose benefits they are entitled to.</p>

 
<h4>Solution required to link the local artisans with the agencies of MoTA</h4><p>
2. There is a disconnect between artisans having local/traditional skills and the government institutions established to support them. A mobile app could be developed to link the local artisans with the agencies of MoTA (TRIFED, NSTFDC and their state counterparts) who have provisions to support them. Artisans can upload their profile including the skill possessed, pictures and videos of their art etc. Based on these profiles the agencies of MoTA could reach out to them with regard to skill up-gradation training, branding, marketing support etc. The artisans could also post queries, request for support in areas like training, marketing, branding etc. which could be addressed by the agencies.</p>

 
<h4>An App required to identify the benefits from the schemes of the MoTA</h4><p>
ST community in general and students in particular are less aware about the benefits that they can avail from existing schemes/ programmes of MoTA. An app may be developed to guide the user regarding their entitlements based on their profile. For e.g. A student can use by providing basic details like their category (ST), gender, age, district, State, parental income through which he/she may be able to identify the benefits from the schemes of the MoTA (scholarships, hostels, fellowships etc.) for which he/she is entitled to. Farmers can use the app for increasing their farm productivity by availing benefits from various ongoing schemes of MoTA in a click. Based on their profile information (land size, its nature, location etc.) a list of entitlement from various schemes of MoTA could be made accessible through the mobile app. These could be linked to Digital Locker also.</p>

             <h4> Posting/ transfers at the level of JE/AE/EE in CPWD </h4><p>
A software could be devised taking into account the existing posting/ transfer guidelines in CPWD and based on various criteria for transfer (minimum residency, hard/ NE posting Spouse posting, HQ field, preference etc.). The software can automatically throw up suggestions for transfer of officers based on their profile. This will be a very useful input for the transfer/ posting Committee for taking a final view.</p>


<h4>The impact of GST can vary from sector to sector and depends on whether the project is under execution</h4><p>
The impact of GST can vary from sector to sector and depends on whether the project is under execution. The potential savings in the project cost can also vary according to cost structure inherent to each project. There are various goods and services which have different rates prescribed by GST, which impact their cost. Overall, Construction sector is likely to benefit under GST regime due to provision of availability of input tax credit. As under the current tax regime the benefit of input tax paid is not fully available, the benefits arising out of input tax credit on the raw-materials available under the GST regime would result in an overall neutral tax incidence for construction services. The measurement of tax incidence also holds lot of importance. It was claimed that implementation of GST will lead to removal of the cascading tax effect. This cascading tax effect has led to inflationary prices due to the fact that load of tax on tax has to be borne by consumer. However, the comparative information of final cost/price of Goods & services in the urban development sector before introduction of GST and post GST is not available. Technology that can address this partially An online programme can be developed which will apply the prescribed GST rates to all the inputs generally required in construction/ real estate sector and clearly bring out the difference it make in the final cost of housing, construction and infrastructure projects. This programme can be hosted on the current MoHUA website or only an external link can be provided on MoHUA website. This program can be designed to identify the tax rate applicable to particular input and amount of tax required to be paid for that input calculated in INR. This tax amount in INR can be arrived by feeding in amount spend on particular input (say cement) and program will apply the GST rate and provide tax liability. Once all figures are filled in, the program should provide total cost for pre-GST and post GST period. The total GST paid can also be calculated and can be compared with pre-GST period tax period. For calculating tax for post-GST period, notified GST rate structure for goods and services by CBEC to calculate the amount of tax applicable to the inputs used and for pre- GST period, applicable VAT, CENVAT and excise rates etc. can be used. Desired Outcome: It will allow comparative analysis of prices of various Goods & services used in the urban development sector and ascertaining the impact of GST on the final costing and subsequently reflected in the prices of the housing units and infrastructure projects.

<h4>Common Mobility App</h4><p>
The thought process behind this mobile application is that information is the key. Delivering right information at the right time can boost usage of public transport system. This will help government to understand people’s mobility needs, public transport usage & adaptability. This app should have a journey planner for the commuter adopting the concept of multi-modality in its approach & developments, i.e. travel from one destination / direction to another using all possible modes having lower emission goals / standards.
</p>

<h4>Common Platform for Vehicle Registration</h4><p>
Another major concern of governance is the availability of valid data on vehicle registration from an authentic source. This helps in decision making, data exchange and decide scale of output from governance side. For example, registration of vehicles done by the RTO at city level can be shared on a common platform. This data can be provided to national / State level body, since vehicles travel across states, to curb or understand the growth of vehicle population, analyse accidental data, evaluate the pollution level, fuel consumption, etc. A software or web portal can help in collecting & evaluating the data. This can be replicated for collecting information about services like road inventory, ITS implementation and other urban transport projects.</p>

<h4>Preparation of Aquifer Vulnerability Maps for Upcoming cluster/township</h4><p>
Aquifer protection is essential for sustainable use of ground water resources and protection of the dependent ecosystems. The key expression for quantification of aquifer protection is vulnerability. Vulnerability of an aquifer is defined as the sensitivity of the aquifer to an imposed contaminant load, which is determined by the intrinsic characteristics of the aquifer. Currently, assessment of the ground water vulnerability is done on the basis of the available water quality data alone. But, such an assessment does not give a clear picture of an area since aquifer vulnerability depends on many other factors. Such assessments should be exercised by developing an index based approaches. This exercise can be taken up for such areas where industrial clusters/townships are being planned. Prerequisites A set of parameters, such as land use, topography, soil type, depth of vadose zone, aquifer lithology, depth to water level, aquifer parameters, ground water recharge of an area in question Roles: Data Providers: Various government departments, academic institutions, NGOs working in the proposed area.

<h4>Awareness on Aarsenic contamination in ground water</h4><p>
Shallow aquifers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Manipur and Karnataka are ingested with arsenic geogenic contamination and such water is being used for drinking and irrigation by the inhabitants leading to diseases. Though arsenic free safe deep aquifers are being tapped for water supply, however public uses shallow aquifer water through private dug wells and tube well for drinking and domestic purposes and get diseases due to arsenic contamination. CGWB is monitoring groundwater quality annually as well as in special studies for arsenic contamination. If this data can be used for creating awareness amongst local inhabitants by creating a webpage as well as mobile app, many people can be made aware to use alternative water source and avoid diseases due to arsenic contamination. Roles: Data Provider: CGWB Consumer: Public Solution: CGWB, MoWR,RD & GR can create awareness about arsenic contamination Also some good practices can be advertised through it.</p>

 
 <h4>Know your Back Yard and Farm Yard</h4><p>
Availability of quantum of water resources and its quality varies widely through out India based on the type of Aquifer System and anthropogenic interferences. Knowing both the parameter are of paramount importance for the public before using the ground water resources through various means. The dissemination of such information will be of great help to the public as a whole including spreading the awareness. Roles: Data Provider: CGWB, State Ground Water Departments & Drinking water Departments.

<h4>Risks of overuse and contamination of Ground water</h4><p>
Ground water is most preferred source of water for irrigation, industry and drinking / domestic purposes in the country. There are more than 30 million tube-wells owned privately for withdrawal of ground water. Over withdrawal of ground water from aquifers not only cause drying of abstraction structures due to decline in water table but also cause vulnerability to contamination of geogenic and anthropogenic in nature. It is proposed to develop an app which can help stakeholders to indicate how much ground water can be withdrawn safely from aquifers in their area as well as suggesting feasible recharge measures. Prerequisites Set of facilities Roles: Data Providers : Member of Gram panchayat / Tehsil. Consumers : Water Management Ministry. Solution Identify area where withdrawal of ground water crosses or reaches the safely withdrawal ground water level. It will help to take decisions based on data to take preventive measures or constructing new dams to improve ground water level.

<h4>Dissemination of information related to availability of water in reservoir</h4><p>
The country has been facing drought like condition in many parts almost every year. The availability of storages are very low in our country. In view of above an informed utilization of water available in various storages is the need of hour. CWC is compiling information on availability of water in 91 important reservoirs in the country. This data is however useful but not helpful in creating awareness among the people to restrict wasteful utilization of water in distress condition. It is proposed to create an application on web as well as on mobile which can provide information through a common public regarding availability of water in the reservoir serving his area. Roles: Data Providers : CWC Consumers : Common Public Solution CWC will publish the data in the water reservoirs time to time Also some good practices to save water can be advertised through this</p>

 
<h4>Collection on information on harkhetkopani</h4><p>
One of the objective of the Prime Minister KrishiSinchaiYojna is to ensure harkhetkopani. However, the information regarding areas which are receiving irrigation water is not readily available. This is one of the important bottleneck in identification of areas needing immediate help from the above scheme. It is proposed to develop a mobile based platform for entry of data by common public regarding the status of irrigation coverage of his farm land. The concerned person may be given with the facility to enter data like source of water for their field as well as quantity and quality.

         <h4>National Creche Portal/App</h4><p>
Under the National Crèche Scheme and the erstwhile Rajiv Gandhi National Crèche Scheme, a number of crèches have been functioning across the country. These are mainly NGOs under the ambit of two mother NGOs. When the verification of these crèches was done, a large number were found to be non-functional on the ground. Also there is no proper database of the children that come to these crèches and the staff that is working there. A database can hugely help in monitoring the scheme. General problem statement: i) At present, the crèches self report the number of children availing their services. However there is no record of the identities of the children. ii) This can lead to manipulation/wrong reporting of data. iii) The verification of the crèches showed that a large number of the crèches are non-existent on the ground. System users: i) Crèche workers: for entering the data of children and staff ii) Parents: to locate nearest crèches iii) NGO managing the crèches including the mother NGO: for looking at the number of children, attendance etc. iv) District Administration: Should be able to access crèche-wise details. It is necessary for the purpose of inspections and monitoring v) State Government: Should be able to access district-wise crèche-wise details. It is necessary for the purpose of monitoring. vi) Central Government: Should be able to access pan-India data for the purpose of monitoring. Technology that can address this issue partially: i) Geo-tagging the crèches so as to know their precise location. The app should be able to give the location of the nearest crèche in case a parent wants to find the nearest crèche to his/her home. ii) Each geo-tagged crèche should be able to real time fetch the number of children availing of its services, the number of staff working in it. iii) In convergence with the other services such as immunisation, health-checkups under RBSK, regular health checkups etc. there should be entries of the same in the database. If a particular service has not been updated for a long time beyond some time duration, e.g. immunisation for a particular child has been missed, the database should generate alerts for necessary intervention. iv) The database of children and staff should contain all the necessary details. These details can be captured with the help of Aadhar as well, hence the need for that functionality. v) Thereafter each day with the help of biometric, the attendance of the children and staff in the institution should be taken. This number should be displayed in the dashboard. The attendance could be taken by the help of a phone – as soon as the child enters the crèche, a photo is taken and an auto generated receipt is also sent to the parent (that the child is in the crèche). At the time when the children leaves the crèche, a similar photo should be taken with the parent and a receipt generated. Desired Outcome: i) A Mobile Application which will help citizens find their nearest crèche. ii) A monitoring system for authorities to ensure proper implementation of the scheme. iii) The monitoring of Dashboard by higher level officer directly will ensure timely redressal of the grievances.

<h4>Portal for Child Care Institutions</h4><p>
The Child Care Insitutions (CCIs) and Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) are integral institutions in achieving the objectives of the Juvenile Justice Act. The Child Care Institutions can be categorised into children’s homes, open shelters, observation home, special home, place of safety and SAAs. There is felt a need to have a database for the children and the staff staying or working in these institutions. This database can then be used to monitor the attendance and other related services of the children and staff. Also the performance of Child Welfare Committees needs to be ascertained by monitoring it electronically. Both these objectives can be addressed in a portal. General problem statement: i) At present, the child care institutions self report the number of children staying in their institution. While the number of children is tracked, the identities are not captured, except for OAS (orphaned, abandoned and surrendered) children in the CARINGs website. ii) The demand for funds is made by these CCIs under Integrated Child Protection Scheme. The release of funds is contingent on the number of children staying in these institutions and the number of staff in these institutions. This can lead to manipulation/wrong reporting of data by the CCIs. iii) The Child Welfare Committee is mandated under the Juvenile Justice Act for completing its proceedings in a certain fixed time period. For instance except for OAS children, this time period is four months. For OAS children under two years of age, it is two months and for OAS children above two years of age, this is four months. However it is seen that there are considerable delays in the completion of proceedings by the CWC. System users: i) Officials of Child Care institutions: for entering the data of children and staff. They will be able to know the progress of the case, next hearing for preparing necessary documentation. ii) Parents who are searching for their children: They can login into a particular CCI database to search for their missing children iii) Child Welfare Committee members: It will be able to tell them of the pendency list and the case-wise details for necessary action at their end. iv) District Child Protection Unit: Since the Probation Officer is the nodal officer in the district, he/she can monitor the work of CWC. He/she can use the data on the database for the purpose of inspections anytime or to monitor the attendance of staff. v) District Magistrate: The DM is mandated under the Juvenile Justice Act to review the functioning of CWCs. This dashboard can enable him/her to do so and take necessary action. He/she can use the data on the database for the purpose of inspections anytime or to monitor the attendance of staff. vi) States: For having a state-wide view and being able to review the performance of various districts. vii) Centre: For monitoring the country-wide performance. Technology that can address this issue partially: i) Having a database of children and staff. ii) This database should contain the following fields For children: a. Name b. Date of birth c. Address d. Photo e. Name of parents/guardians f. When found. By whom. His/her contact details g. Date of entry in the institution h. Date of leaving the institution For staff: a. Name b. DoB c. Address d. Photo e. Date of appointment iii) There will be additions and deletions to the database as and when the children enter the institution. iv) The above information can also be captured by having Aadhar registration of the children and staff. v) Thereafter, each day with the help of biometric, the attendance of the children and staff in the institution should be taken. This number should be displayed on the dashboard. vi) The functionality of the database can be improved by having other services on it. For instance the medical condition of the child, the details of last vaccination, the details of last medical check-up, the details of the school he is going to, the educational standard. There should be provision for regular updation of these fields and if there is no regular update, it should give an alert thereby signifying that the vaccination or medical-checkup is not being done. vii) There needs to be developed a dashboard for case monitoring in the above portal. viii) For each case that comes up before the Child Welfare Committee, the details of the case are keyed in into the system. ix) The dashboard should then be able to show the number of cases that are in various time periods like between 0-15 days, 15-30 days and so on and should also show the mandated time period. Based on the two, a defaulter case list should be created. x) There should be built-in alerts into the system. As a particular case is nearing its mandated time period there should be alerts to the CWC members, DCPU and the CCI. xi) Each sitting of the CWC should also be entered into the system along with the number of the members that attend it. The cases that are taken up on those sittings and the consequent decision on them should also be fed into the system Desired Outcome: i) A dashboard which helps multiple users track the cases of children in Child Care Institutions and cases pending before the Child Welfare Committee ii) The monitoring of dashboard by higher level officer directly will ensure timely action.</p>

 
<h4>Grievance Redressal through App and IVR in ICDS</h4><p>
Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) scheme is being implemented all over the nation through 14 lakh Anganwadi centres. There are over 8 crore beneficiaries. The beneficiaries include children between the age group of 6 months – 6 years, pregnant women & lactating mothers. An online complaint filing and real time monitoring of the actions taken over the complaints are necessary to improve the conditions of Anganwadi centres. A Mobile Application as well as IVR system can be developed through which anybody can complain about the issues in Anganwadi Services. General problem statement: i) Mobile application to file complaints with regard to the different services provided by the Anganwadi centres. The application should have an option to upload pictures and to give details about the Anganwadi centre’s location. ii) As most of the beneficiaries are illiterate, an IVR system can be developed to ensure accessibility of the services to all. For which a call center kind of set up can be established at the centre level. The employees of the call centre will enter the complaints received through IVR into the online portal. iii) The complaints should be automatically forwarded to the corresponding field functionaries i.e. CDPOs/DPOs on entry into the portal through SMS and notifications in the mobile application. iv) A dashboard to be developed to monitor the action taken over the complaints received both through App and IVR system. v) The application and IVR system can be used to create awareness about the scheme. vi) This application should be developed in such as way to integrate other Schemes of the Ministry in future. System users: i) Citizens will be the main users this services as they are the beneficiaries of the ICDS schemes. ii) Administration to address complaints and monitor redressal iii) Government will get benefitted as it would act as a feedback of their service delivery mechanism at field level. This would further help us to further refine the scheme and ensure proper delivery of services to the beneficiaries Technology that can address this issue partially: i) An application to take the grievence redressal mechanism nearer to the ICDS beneficiaries with respect to the services received. ii) An IVR number to call and file the complaint by simply pressing numbers. iii) This app should be loosely coupled so that it can integrate with the ICDS-CAS in future. Any system in operation to ingest data for various schemes. iv) The app should also support screen reader so that all citizens can click on the voice button and listen to the complete audio on the screen in an interactive manner. v) A dashboard to monitor the action taken over the complaints. Desired Outcome: i) A mobile application and IVR system which will help the citizens to file their grievances without revealing their identity. ii) A grievance redressal mechanism which can be extended to schemes other than ICDS scheme of the ministry in future. iii) The monitoring of dashboard by higher level officer directly will ensure timely redressal of the grievances.</p>

 
<h4>C2C crowd-sourcing platform for projects on women’s empowerment</h4><p>
While there are a large number of individuals and organizations working for the cause of women’s empowerment, many struggle to find support in terms of finance as well as the right kind of human resources. On the other hand, there are also many individuals and companies that are willing to provide their time and support to these causes/projects. A platform which connects these two sets of people can encourage many initiatives for gender equality, which would otherwise not be able to get off the ground. An online platform may be developed to facilitate this interaction, while maintaining a level of security for the users. The operations and maintenance of the platform may be given to an in-house or outsourced team. General problem statement: i) At present, private platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdera and Freelancer help connect projects to financial and human resources ii) There is no platform catering to both profit and non-profit ventures specifically for women empowerment iii) There is also no platform which allows exchange of skills as well finances in one place iv) A government-run C2C crowd-sourcing platform will fill this gap and allow individuals and organizations looking for funding and other support to connect with others who can provide this support to them. System users: i) The individuals or organizations that are seeking support ii) The individuals or organizations that want to offer support iii) Administrators to verify and monitor transaction of funds and services Technology that can address this issue partially: i) An online portal which allows registration of users through automated KYC verification followed by a level of offline verification by a team. ii) The creative use of technology should be explored to create the best possible protection against fraud, fake identities, money laundering etc. iii) The portal should have the option of a payment gateway so people may choose to pay directly iv) The system should create profiles for different types of users while also allowing both public and private interactions between them v) There should be a system of public reviews and ratings for all types of users Desired Outcome: i) An online portal where users can post about their projects and requirements, which can be met by users offering their services and support ii) A system of automatic verification to help avoid fraud iii) An online payment gateway to allow direct transfer of funds between users iv) A method for administrators to block profiles of users in case of fraud or inappropriate content v) The platform will be focused on projects for the cause of women’s empowerment including but not restricted to advocacy campaigns, research projects, technological solutions, art, films, social enterprises, NGO projects etc.</p>

 
<h4>App for training of Elected Women Representatives in Panchayat Raj Institutions</h4><p>
In order to empower women representatives elected at panchayat levels across the country, MWCD has initiated a massive training program across the country. The objective is to build their capacities around the issues related to village level management, basic knowledge of government schemes, social issues and their resolution, management of panchayat finances, village infrastructure etc. A training module has been developed for this, which is to be converted to an App version for interesting and interactive usage by Elected Women Representatives and trainers. General problem statement: i) At present Elected Women Representatives (EWR) don’t have the sources to know about the schemes of the government ii) Women face a lot of social pressure or patriarchal pressure from the society and have no means to gather information iii) Government conducts training workshop for EWR’s but are unable to train the women due to various issues listed above iv) The training workshops are far away from the villages and women have no means of travelling to the destination v) It’s hard to find proficient trainers that can conduct training in remote towns or village vi) The lack of automation to provide support and train EWR’s can become a huge obstacle developing the status of women in society vii) The need is to empower these EWR’s with an interactive app to help them get the information within seconds at the Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI) viii) The basic premise of this exercise is the idea that informed and well trained EWR’s and leaders will be equipped to handle their roles and responsibilities independently and will be in a better position to participate effectively in panchayat affairs The users of this system are mainly one: i) Women are the main users of this app, they need this app to help them get information about government schemes, social issues and their resolution, management of panchayat finances, village infrastructure etc. ii) Government administration that want to disseminate knowledge to these EWR’s, so that they can be equipped to handle their roles and responsibilities independently and will be in a better position to participate effectively in panchayat affairs. Technology that can address this issue partially. i) A Web Responsive app to educate women of the various schemes of the government, major social issues & their resolution, provide information on management of panchayat finances, village infrastructure etc. ii) Sample data would be provided so that relevant information can be categorized and utilized to create the app. iii) This app should be loosely coupled so that it can integrate with any system in operation to ingest data for various schemes iv) The app should also support screen reader so that all EWR’s can click on the voice button and listen to the complete audio on the screen in an interactive manner Desired Outcome: i) A app which will help the EWR’s get the required information in the least amount of time ii) The app will help all the EWR’s run their panchayats in an effective manner and take help from the latest schemes of the government to further improve the state of their village</p>

 
<h4>App with Government Services for women</h4><p>
MWCD is in the process of launching a web portal with extensive information on schemes for women implemented by various Ministries, Departments, States & UTs. This also has information on areas concerning women such as health check ups, nutrition tips, hygiene methods, how to apply for basic documentation, bank transactions, investments, interview tips etc. A corresponding app may be developed to provide the same information in an interactive manner on a smart phone. General problem statement: i) At present all the services for women in the areas of employment, health, education, violence, legal support, social security, housing & infrastructure etc. are provided on the web site & are only accessible to people with internet. ii) The citizens do not have the facility to call in and check about the different schemes of the government for women. iii) Government tries to provide all the information on their websites, but due to lack of awareness the information does not get disseminated. iv) The actual need of the hour is to use as many avenues possible to spread knowledge about schemes and increase demand and usage of schemes. System users: i) Citizens are the main users of this app, as they need maximum information about different schemes and initiatives for women by the government ii) The administration wants to provide maximum modes of transmission of the information Technology that can address this issue partially. i) An application to educate citizens (mainly women) of the various schemes of the government, for the empowerment and welfare of women ii) Sample data would be provided so that relevant information can be categorized and utilized to create the app. iii) This app should be loosely coupled so that it can integrate with any system in operation to ingest data for various schemes iv) The app should also support screen reader so that all citizens can click on the voice button and listen to the complete audio on the screen in an interactive manner Desired Outcome: i) A app which will help the citizens get the required information in the least amount of time and information at their finger tips ii) This app will help the citizens get the maximum information</p>

 
<h4>Case Management Software for Women Helpline</h4><p>
181 Women Helpline is currently functional in 23 States/UTs. This will be scaled up to cover all States/UTs in the near future to make it a universal number for women. 181 provides 24 hours emergency response to women in distress through referral (linking with appropriate authority such as police, one stop centre, hospital etc.) as well as information about women related government schemes. 181 numbers across the country receive a large number of calls a day. User friendly case management software is required for staff to maintain details of all incoming cases. Such software will further help in easier reporting through auto-populated tables. It should lend itself to integration with OSC and other software at a later date. General problem statement: i) At present the complaints or requests reported by women are manually entered by WHL staff and no software is there to log and track the complaint ii) Cases are thus tedious to track at the WHL level iii) Hard copy of case details have to be sent outside the WHL when a case is referred to a lawyer, doctor, One Stop Centre etc. iv) As the Nirbhaya dashboard for central level monitoring is implemented, each WHL will have to manually input total numbers of registered, resolved and pending cases v) This also leads to lack of transparency within the system which reduces the accountability of the administration vi) 23 states has set up helplines, with all to be covered soon. System users: i) The women that register for help. They can be given a case ID no. ii) The WHL staff who register the complaint/query. A summary of the case should be downloadable for easy forwarding outside the OSC via email. iii) At a later stage, if a State or National level monitoring system is implemented, this software should be able to integrate with it Technology that can address this issue partially. i) An online portal or an app for case management or process management to track the status of complaints of women. ii) The data sets should be generated to make them look real iii) This system should be loosely coupled so that it can integrate with any system in operation iv) This system should also support dashboarding and analytics to generate reports or tables instantly v) This system should be able to send in alerts (SMS/ Emails) whenever a case is logged to the required official or referral Desired Outcome: i) A transparent system that will track the complaint status of women with case specific details that can be viewed by OSC staff through log in. ii) This system will help track all the complaints of women and would make it affective tool to provide help to affected women. iii) This system will help in improving transparency, increase accountability, help in providing right care in time. iv) This system will also serve with analytics for the state or the country once integrated and can populate various reports & dashboards at National/ State/ UT level.</p>

 
<h4>Case Management Software for one stop center (OSC)</h4><p>
There are currently 141 One Stop Centres (OSCs) across 30 States/UTs providing access to an integrated range of services including police, medical, legal and psychological support to women affected by violence. Additional OSCs are envisaged to be set up in the upcoming phases. A large number of women are using the services of the OSCs. User friendly case management software would help OSC staff keep better track of cases and aid in monitoring through auto-populated tables. Total figures of cases registered, resolved and pending should automatically reflect on the Nirbhaya dashboard (in the process of development). The software should be able to integrate with Women Helpline and other software at a later date. General problem statement: i) At present the complaints reported by women are mostly entered manual at the OSC level ii) Cases are thus tedious to track at the OSC level iii) Hard copy of case details have to be sent outside the OSC when a case is referred to a lawyer, doctor etc. iv) As the Nirbhaya dashboard for central level monitoring is implemented, each OSC will have to manually input total numbers of registered, resolved and pending cases v) This also leads to lack of transparency within the system which reduces the accountability of the administration System users: i) The women that register for help. They can be given a case ID no. ii) The OSC administrator who register the complaint. A summary of the case should be downloadable for easy forwarding outside the OSC via email. iii) At a later stage, if a State or National level monitoring system is implemented, this software should be able to integrate with it Technology that can address this issue partially: i) An online portal or an app for case management or process management to track the status of complaints of women. ii) The data sets should be generated to make them look real iii) This system should have API’s built into them to consume data from other sources iv) This system should also support dashboarding and analytics to generate reports or tables instantly Desired Outcome: i) A transparent system that will track the complaint status of women with case specific details that can be viewed by OSC staff through log in. ii) This system will help track all the complaints of women and would make it affective tool to provide help to affected women. iii) This system will help in improving transparency, increase accountability, help in providing right care in time. iv) This system will also serve with analytics for the state or the country once integrated and can populate various reports & dashboards at National/ State/ UT level.</p>
